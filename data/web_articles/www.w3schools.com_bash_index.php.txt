Learn Bash
Bash is used to write scripts and run commands on Linux systems.
It helps automate tasks, manage system operations, and boost productivity.
Understanding Shells
A shell is a text-based interface that lets you talk to your computer.
There are different types of shells, but Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the most popular because it's powerful and easy to use.
Types of Shells:
Bourne Shell (sh):The original Unix shell, developed by Stephen Bourne.
C Shell (csh):Known for its C-like syntax, popular for interactive use.
Korn Shell (ksh):Combines features of sh and csh, offering advanced scripting capabilities.
Bash (Bourne Again SHell):An improved version of sh, with additional features like command history and tab completion.
Why Use Bash?
It is widely available on Unix/Linux systems, making scripts portable.
Supports powerful scripting features, including loops, conditionals, and functions.
Provides command history and tab completion for ease of use.
Can be integrated with other Unix/Linux tools for automation.
