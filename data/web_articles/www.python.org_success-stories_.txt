Zama Concrete ML: Simplifying Homomorphic Encryption for Python Machine Learning
To simplify the adoption of FHE, which involves a complex and resource-intensive technological stack, Zama developed tools that streamline the integration of FHE into applications. Since Python is the de facto standard for building machine learning (ML) applications, it was an obvious choice to create an open-source FHE library in Python.Read more
Building Robust Codebases with Python's Type Annotations
Maintaining our ever-evolving Python codebase poses an intricate challenge: how do we make updates to reflect the changing rules and regulations of 200+ global markets without compromising access to the systems that our engineers and traders use on a daily basis? While an inner layer of shared business logic enables coherency in our codebase performance, it also means small regulatory changes can impact many systems.

In this article, Python Engineer John Lekberg details how we use Python type annotations to minimize the time and risk involved in manual verification.Read more
Building a Dependency Graph of Our Python Codebase
Prioritizing cutting-edge speed and supporting the rapid growth of Hudson River Trading’s codebase can have unintended effects that require innovative solutions. For those working on our Python codebase, this means addressing “code tangling,” the coupling of unrelated code through unintuitive import cycles. In this article, George Farcasiu, Noah Kim, Jacob Brugh, and Jiahao Li discuss how they mitigate the cost and time burden of this issue by creating new tools to analyze and untangle dependencies efficiently.Read more
Lincoln Loop: Building a sustainable business inspired by Python’s ethos
Since its founding in 2007, Lincoln Loop has been building sites for their clients with Python and Django.
