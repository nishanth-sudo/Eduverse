Learn Free Programming LanguagesLast Updated :06 Sep, 2024CommentsImproveSuggest changesLike ArticleLikeReportIn this rapidly growing world, programming languages are also rapidly expanding, and it is very hard to determine the exact number of programming languages. Programming languages are an essential part of software development because they create a communication bridge between humans and computers. Now, if you are a beginner who wants to learn, search the Internet, and you will find a number of programming languages, making it difficult to decide which one is best.Understanding the various programming languages and their strengths and weaknesses is critical for any developer who wants to succeed in the software development field. This blog will get you into the world of programming languages, discussing their significance, usage, and factors to consider when choosing the right one for your next project.If you are seeking a compiled page where you can learn any language for free, then this article has mentioned all the free programming language resources that you can learn in 2024.Table of ContentC LanguageC++Java Programming LanguagePython Programming LanguageR Programming LanguageGolangScalaRubyPerlJuliaSwift;Free Programming Langauge ResoursesLearning to code doesn't have to be expensive, thanks to the abundance of free programming language resources available online. Platforms like  GeeksforGeeks provide comprehensive free tutorials that will help you to learn programming language form strach without any cost.C LanguageAccording to Statista, C holds a 26.6 percent share of the software developer community worldwide. C was developed byDennis M Ritchiein 1970 atAT&T Lab.Naturally, C was developed to design software like text editors, compilers, and network devices. It is also a hidden hero behind operating systems and programs demanding top speed.C TutorialC++C++ is a superstar and successor of the C language hence we can easily call it the brainchild of C. C++ emerged as a heavyweight object-oriented language in 1980.  It craftily merges C's efficiency with object-oriented building blocks like classes and inheritance.Despite its complexity, C++ is a popular language for experienced programmers due to its efficiency and ability to directly manipulate hardware. It is also a great language for learning object-oriented programming concepts, as it provides a high level of control and flexibility.C++ TutorialJava Programming LanguageIn the 1990s, Java emerged as a programming language with a key strength: working on any computer. Unlike earlier languages, Java's code (bytecode) can run on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This "write once, run anywhere" feature makes Java ideal for creating applications that need to function on different operating systems.Popular for web applications and business software, Java is also clear, readable, and object-oriented, making it a favorite among programmers who value both ease of use and flexibility.JAVA Programming TutorialPython Programming LanguageIn the late 1980s, Python joined the programming world with a focus on being easy to understand.  Its code is written clearly, almost like plain English, which makes it a great choice for beginners or programmers of all levels. But Python isn't just easy to read, it also comes with a big toolbox of pre-written code (modules) that helps programmers do all sorts of things, from working with data to building websites. This focus on being clear and having helpful tools has made Python a popular choice for many different programming tasks.Python Programming TutorialR Programming LanguageR isn't like most programming languages. Instead of doing a little bit of everything, R focuses on statistics and data analysis. It became popular in the 1990s with statisticians and data scientists because it has lots of tools specifically designed for working with numbers.  These tools help them clean up data, create charts to see what's going on, and even build models to predict things.  While the way you write things in R might seem different at first, it's a favorite tool for researchers who need to make sense of their data.R ProgrammingGolangGolang, or Go as some call it, is a relatively new programming language, arriving in the 2000s. It was invented by Google engineers to build big software projects.  Unlike some trickier languages, Golang is both fast and easy to read.This mix of speed and readability makes Golang a good choice for building web apps, working in the cloud, and creating the behind-the-scenes systems that power many programs.Golang TutorialScalaScala, a mid-2000s invention, is a programming language with a special talent: it can combine two different ways of writing code (object-oriented and functional) into one. This lets programmers build powerful and adaptable applications.The way you write Scala might seem complex at first, but it's a favorite tool for programmers working with massive amounts of data or creating high-performance programs used in big data and business software.Scala TutorialRubyIn the 1990s, Ruby joined the programming world with a focus on making programmers happy.  Unlike some languages with rigid rules, Ruby is more flexible and easier to read, making it enjoyable to use. But it's not all fun and games! Ruby also has a big toolbox of pre-written code (gems) that helps programmers build web apps, crunch data, and do other things.This focus on being enjoyable to use and its wide range of uses make Ruby a popular choice for web development, especially with the Rails framework.Ruby TutorialPerlPerl, around since the late 1980s, is a bit of an older programming language. It's known for being flexible and really good at working with text. This makes Perl a favorite tool for programmers who handle things like system settings, grabbing information from websites, and even analyzing biological data.While the way you write Perl code might seem a bit confusing at first, it's a powerful tool for programmers who need to do these special jobs with text.Perl TutorialJuliaJulia is a fresh face in the programming world, arriving in the late 2010s. This language is built specifically to help scientists and researchers crunch numbers and analyze data. Julia is super fast, which makes it perfect for handling complex scientific calculations and simulations.And, unlike some other scientific programming languages that can be tricky to learn, Julia is written clearly and easy to read. This mix of speed, readability, and being a whiz with numbers is making Julia a favorite tool for scientists tackling tough computational problems.Julia TutorialSwift;In the mid-2010s, Apple created Swift, a new way to write code specifically for Apple devices like iPhones and iPads.  Swift is known for being clear and easy to learn, which makes it easier for programmers to jump in and start creating apps.This focus on being easy to use and powerful allows programmers to build user-friendly and efficient apps for Apple devices. While Swift is a great choice for building iPhone and iPad apps, it's not yet as popular for creating apps on other devices.Swift TutorialConclusionIn conclusion, programming languages are a fundamental part of the technology landscape, enabling the creation of a wide range of software applications and systems. From the simplicity and flexibility of Python to the power and efficiency of C++, there is a programming language to suit every need and skill level. As we have seen, each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right language for a particular task requires careful consideration of the requirements and constraints involved.Next ArticlePerl Programming LanguagekartikImproveArticle Tags :JavaPythonProgramming LanguageC LanguageC++PerlRubyScalaGo LanguageJuliaSwiftPractice Tags :CPPJavapython
