Can the Updated GPT-4o Really Beat GPT-4.5?
GPT-4o is literally my favorite model to play with. It supports almost everything I do on a day-to-day basis. While the AI world was still buzzing about its powerfulimage generationcapabilities, OpenAI decided to make it even better. Did you hear about the updated GPT-4o model, and how it beats GPT-4.5 on theChatbot Arenaleaderboard? If you’re confused and wondering how it outperforms its predecessor at 10x lower cost, this article is for you. Let’s break down the major updates and see how it stacks up againstGPT-4.5.

What Does Updated GPT-4o Model Offer?
This update enhances the model’s performance, making it feel more intuitive, creative, and collaborative. Key improvements include:
Better Instruction Following:It follows user instructions more accurately.
Improved Coding:It handles coding tasks more smoothly.
Natural Communication:Responses are clearer, more concise, and less cluttered (e.g., fewer markdown levels and emojis), making it easier to read and more focused.
This updated GPT-4o is now available inChatGPTand via theOpenAI API.

Let’s Try it Out
Given the claims of GPT-4o being better than GPT 4.5, let’s try both out on same prompt and evaluate their performance:
Task 1: Coding
Prompt:“Create an HTML5 game where eggs fall vertically from random positions at the top of the screen, starting at 1-second intervals and gradually accelerating. The player controls a catcher (cursor-based) to collect eggs. Each successful catch adds +5 points to the real-time scoreboard, while missed eggs deduct -2 points. The game ends instantly if 3 eggs are missed, triggering a ‘Game Over’ screen with the final score. Implement this using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design.“
Output:
Observation:
While both models generated similar game implementations, GPT-4o demonstrated superior attention to visual design. Specifically:
GPT-4oused a well-optimized color scheme, ensuring clear visibility of eggs against the background.
GPT-4.5, while functional, produced lower contrast between elements, making the eggs slightly harder to distinguish.
Verdict:
GPT-4.5 ❌ | Updated GPT-4o ✅
Task 2: Creative Writing + Instruction Following
Prompt:“Using GPT-4o’s image generation as inspiration, write a poignant 10-line poem capturing the divide between those who believe ‘art belongs only to humans’ and those who celebrate ‘democratized creativity through AI.’ Weave in emotions of resistance, wonder, and the tension between tradition and technological possibility.“
Observation:
While GPT-4.5’s poem presents both perspectives evenly and concludes with harmony, GPT-4o’s version creates stronger emotional contrasts but ends abruptly. Therefore, if you value balance and resolution, 4.5 works better. However, if you prefer intensity over closure, 4o is strong.
Verdict:
GPT-4.5 ❌ | Updated GPT-4o ✅
Task 3: Logical Reasoning
Updated GPT 4o Response:
-- Truth Table: A = false, B = true is the only valid scenario.
-- Proof:
-- 1. Bob says: ¬A
-- 2. If B is a knight → ¬A is true → A is false
-- 3. Alice says: B → ¬A
-- 4. If Alice is a knave, her statement is false → B ∧ A
-- 5. Contradiction unless A = false, B = true ✅
SELECT name, 
       CASE WHEN name = 'Alice' THEN 'knave' 
            WHEN name = 'Bob' THEN 'knight' END AS identity
FROM islanders WHERE name IN ('Alice', 'Bob');
-- Truth Table: A = false, B = true is the only valid scenario.
-- Proof:
-- 1. Bob says: ¬A
-- 2. If B is a knight → ¬A is true → A is false
-- 3. Alice says: B → ¬A
-- 4. If Alice is a knave, her statement is false → B ∧ A
-- 5. Contradiction unless A = false, B = true ✅
SELECT name, 
       CASE WHEN name = 'Alice' THEN 'knave' 
            WHEN name = 'Bob' THEN 'knight' END AS identity
FROM islanders WHERE name IN ('Alice', 'Bob');
GPT 4.5 Response:
SELECT name, type FROM islanders
WHERE (name = 'Alice' AND type = 'Knight')
   OR (name = 'Bob' AND type = 'Knave');
SELECT name, type FROM islanders
WHERE (name = 'Alice' AND type = 'Knight')
   OR (name = 'Bob' AND type = 'Knave');
Observation:
Correct Logical DeductionBoth models correctly identifyAlice as the knaveandBob as the knight.ButGPT-4.5’s proof contradicts its own conclusion (claims Alice is a knight in Step 5, despite earlier correct steps).
