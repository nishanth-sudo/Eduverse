Advantages of System Design
Below are the advantages of System Design:
In Good system design, it is easy to see how all parts of the system connects, interact and function together.
It helps teams plan resources, time, and costs more effectively and reduces any surprises during development.
An efficient system is easy to maintain and update, which saves time and effort in the long run.
It allows the system to grow smoothly. You can add new features or handle more users without major changes.
Good design can enhance the system’s performance, making it faster and more efficient.
Disadvantages of System Design
Below are the disadvantages of System Design:
The process of system design can be time-consuming, especially for large and complex systems.
System design can be expensive, especially if it involves significant research, prototyping, and testing.
System design requires a significant amount of technical expertise, including knowledge of hardware, software, databases, and data structures.
Once a system design is complete, it can be difficult to make changes to the design, especially if the design has already been implemented and deployed.
