Exit vs Exit in C/C++
618 Views
In C/C++, both exit() and _Exit() are used to terminate a program. The exit() performs cleanup like flushing output, closing files, and calling functions, while _Exit() ends the program immediately without doing any cleanup. Now, let us learn the difference between exit() and _Exit() individually in C/C++. C++ exit() Function The exit() function is used to clean up before terminating the program. It calls functions registered with atexit(), flushes file buffers, and returns control to the operating system. Syntax Following is the syntax for exit() function: void exit(int status_value);  Example In this example, we print "Program is running..." and ...Read More
Fastest Algorithm to Find Prime Numbers Using C++
3K+ Views
The fastest algorithm to find the prime numbers is the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It is one of the most efficient ways to find the prime numbers smaller than n when n is smaller than around 10 million.  In this article, we have a given number as 'num'. Our task is to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to num using Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in C++. Example Here is an example to find prime numbers less than 10: Input: num = 10  Output: 2 3 5 7   The explanation of the above ...Read More
Find Longest Increasing Subsequence in C++
903 Views
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements and without changing the order of elements in sequence. For example, the sequences [3, 10], [3, 2, 20] and [3, 10, 20] are some of the subsequences of [3, 10, 2, 1, 20].  Longest Increasing Subsequence(LIS) is the longest of all the subsequences that are having elements in increasing order. In this article, we will learn how to write a C++ program to find the length of longest increasing subsequence for a given sequence. In other words, we are provided with a sequence ...Read More
Difference between Relational Operator and std::string::compare in C++
339 Views
In C++, both relational Operators (==) with std::string and std::string::compare() are used to compare two strings for equality, but there's a minor difference in both of these; == compares and returns the results in Boolean, whereas compare() checks lexicographically and returns the result in integers.     In this article, we will see a more detailed comparison between these two methods and their uses in different scenarios. The == Operator The relational operator (==) is used to compare two values; it checks if the two given values are equal or not and returns the result in Boolean (True ...Read More
Semicolons in C++
1K+ Views
A semicolon in C++ is used to terminate or end the statement; it tells the compiler that this particular instruction is completed.According to the ISO C++ specifications, the lexical representation of C++ programs (breaking down code into small parts) is called tokens. Some of these tokens are punctuators, which are special symbols used to structure your code. The semicolon is one of these punctuators.
Example
Here is the following basic example code showcasing the working of a semicolon in C++.
#include 
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5;  // End of declaration statement
    x = 10;     // End of assignment statement
    cout
How Does a Vector Work in C++
291 Views
In C++, a vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink automatically. It can store elements in a row (contiguous memory) and resizes itself when needed. When it runs out of space, it creates a bigger array, copies the old data, and adds the new one. So, you can easily add, remove, or access elements using functions like push_back(), size(), and erase(). Basic Operations (push_back, access) A vector stores elements in a contiguous memory block. You can add elements using push_back() and access them using [] or at(). Syntax Following is the syntax is as follows: vector vec; ...Read More
C++ Program to Perform Addition Using Bitwise Operators
2K+ Views
Bitwise operators are used for representing binary integers, where the operator directly performs operations on the individual bits of integer values. To perform an addition operation using bitwise operators, use operators like AND, XOR, and NOT. The OR operator cannot perform addition on its own because, 1 | 1 results in 1, but we need 2 as the output. Therefore, you can use the other three operators to implement the logic of addition. You can see the tabular representation of biwise operators by taking binary bits as 0 and 1.           ...Read More
Left Shift and Right Shift Operators in C/C++
2K+ Views
Both the left shift and right shift are known as bitwise shift operators. These operators are useful for working with binary integers by shifting the bits to the left or right.
Below is the mathematical representation of the left and right shift operators:
// left shift operator
x > n means (x/2n)

What is Left Shift Operator?
In the left shift operator, the left operand value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
Syntax
The basic syntax of left shift operator as follows:
Convert Numbers to Words Using Python
1K+ Views
The given task is to convert the numerical values to their respective word representation (i.e, we need to spell the numbers in text ). For example, if the given numbers are 1, 2, 29, the resultant values would be: one, two, twenty-nine, respectively. We can do so, using the function(s) available in the num2word library. Converting Numbers to Words Using num2word() The num2words() is a function of the Python library with the same name (num2words). This is used to convert numbers like 56 to words like fifty-six. In addition to the numerical parameters, this function accepts two optional parameters -   ...Read More
Declare Global Variable in Python Class
11K+ Views
A global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning it is visible and accessible throughout the program.     The collection of all global variables is known as the global environment or global scope of the program. The variables declared outside the function are, by default, global variables.  We use the global keyword before a variable inside a function or method to indicate that we are referring to the global variable rather than creating a new local one. The following is the syntax to declare a global variable inside a function ...Read More

Data Science Tutorial
The world is now ruled by data. This has caused an exceptional need for Data Scientists. We have already encountered data science in various ways, whether you use a search engine to get information on the Internet or ask your mobile device for directions, you are engaging with data science applications. Data Science has been important in handling some of our most routine everyday activities for numerous years. You will be able to handle the data in the most efficient manner if you have a good knowledge of data science.
What is Data Science?
Data Science is also known as data-driven science, which makes use of scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, i.e. either structured or unstructured. Data Science uses the most advanced hardware, programming systems, and algorithms to solve problems that have to do with data. It is where artificial intelligence is going.
Data Science Applications
The following are the applications of data science:
Gaming Industry
Health Care
Medical Image Analysis
Predictive Analysis
Image Recognition
Recommendation systems
Airline Routing Planning
Finance
Improvement in Health Care services
Computer Vision
Efficient Management of Energy
Internet Search
Speech Recognition
Education
Data Science Careers / Job Opportunities
The following are some career paths and job opportunities in data science:
