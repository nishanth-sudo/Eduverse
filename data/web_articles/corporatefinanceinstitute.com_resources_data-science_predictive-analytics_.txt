What Our Students Say
Over 75% of CFI learners report improved productivity or competency within weeks.
FMVA certification is challenging, robust and interesting that equips an accounting/finance professional with world-class skills set to advance their careers excel in their endeavors!
This course was very detailed and structured. I would definitely recommend this Certification for any budding Financial Analyst.
I believe the program fully performs what it promises, bridging the gap between work and higher education. For me it means an added value that I cannot describe in words. The program focuses on technical knowledge, which is highly valued since, on average, a student only learns theory before starting work.
Strongly recommend to everyone who wants to receive new careers opportunities and enhance their knowledge in finance. CFI FMVA is perfect opportunity for everyone to obtain neccessary and strong background in financial modeling and valuation of companies. CFI helped me a lot with providing a financial aid and now my profile as a finance specialist is much more attractive and I receive additional confidence in my valuation skills. Thanks to everybody in the CFI team for creating such brilliant courses.
The resources are very educational and will go a long way not only for me but also for our colleagues in the energy regulatory agency. I appreciate very much the CFI material!
Big thank you to Tim Vipond for this incredible course. After much hard work, I now possess valuable financial modeling capabilities such as building discounted cash flow models, building dynamically linked 3-statement models, and building multi-year forecasts to project income statements, cash flows, and balance sheets into the future. In addition, I can draw upon multiple methods of financial and valuation analysis (including ratio analysis, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, accretion/dilution analysis, comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and discounted cash flow analysis) in order to assess the risks and rewards of investment opportunities.
Highly recommend the FMVA to everyone including people already in relevant careers who want to maximize their productivity or finance undergrads before they start their IB internships and want to make an impression.
This is a no-brainer for anyone still using their mouse in Excel.
I am honored to be amongst the other certified holders and I am excited to put into practice the many things I learnt from this program.
This experience has refined the way I build my financial models, with the added bonus of learning how to apply scenario and sensitivity analysis to answer what if questions.
Someone with no finance or accounting background can take this program and will not have any difficulties grasping the concepts.
The skills are actual real-world skills (unlike most financial qualifications) that have already helped me land a new role.
I would absolutely recommend CFI’s training for anyone who’s looking to rapidly increase their ability to add value through a certification program.
The FMVA program is the best professional certification course I have ever done. The course is hands on experience with relevant industry examples.
CFI’s FMVA is the epitome of practical financial analysis and with it, you do not need years of practice to know the content. You are fully baked by the time you finish the course.

The best course to have in depth knowledge of Credit analysis. I would recommend this course to all who are in process to learn credit analysis.
CBCA is a very relevant certification for professionals who are or aspire to be in Commercial Banking and for people who want to have a general understanding of finance.
I found the CBCA as one of the best certificates in banking, and I recommend all Relationship Managers in SME/Corporate banking, and the credit risk assessors to take this designation.
All courses of the CBCA program were provided in a very clear and easily understandable way. The lecturers were covering the subjects in a very effective manner. The design of the presentations looks very pleasant too.

What Our Members Say
This particular course is very engaging and clear even for me, who have very little knowledge of finance.
The introductory course was very concise, detailed, and informative with relevant real world examples which significantly helped apply the concepts in assessing my own business’ footprint.
ESG specialization is highly required skills and glad CFI is solving that issue.
CFI’s ESG programme is a very useful tool towards mitigating contemporary challenges facing the business world.
Displaying the varying investment strategies a ESG-observant business may pursue, along with the relative factors taken into consideration for each strategy, enabled me to understand a business’ general stance on an ESG-related concept, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The bonus content pertaining to the use of data tables to automatically generate status quo figures was an enlightening trick, even for a frequent Excel user.
The Course was very educating, precise and informative. The diagrams helped a lot in understanding the terms and concept being explained.
Very practical and presents the most update-to-date practice and standards in ESG disclosure over the world.
My employer had asked me to look into it to prepare an ESG initiative for our company. I was so relieved to see that CFI offered an ESG course. I was super thrilled to learn so many new skill sets and topic areas.
Great illustration of the potential for ESG to impact a business. Incorporating a holistic view to complement the initiatives proposed and sensible assumptions with a high degree of prudence as to the positive ESG impact on WACC and employee and customer behaviour.
The course really helped me in understanding the various ESG factors that may affect the decisions and have an impact on its stakeholders.

What Our Students Say
Over 75% of CFI learners report improved productivity or competency within weeks.
This particular course is very engaging and clear even for me, who have very little knowledge of finance.
The introductory course was very concise, detailed, and informative with relevant real world examples which significantly helped apply the concepts in assessing my own business’ footprint.
ESG specialization is highly required skills and glad CFI is solving that issue.
CFI’s ESG programme is a very useful tool towards mitigating contemporary challenges facing the business world.
Displaying the varying investment strategies a ESG-observant business may pursue, along with the relative factors taken into consideration for each strategy, enabled me to understand a business’ general stance on an ESG-related concept, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The bonus content pertaining to the use of data tables to automatically generate status quo figures was an enlightening trick, even for a frequent Excel user.
The Course was very educating, precise and informative. The diagrams helped a lot in understanding the terms and concept being explained.
Very practical and presents the most update-to-date practice and standards in ESG disclosure over the world.
My employer had asked me to look into it to prepare an ESG initiative for our company. I was so relieved to see that CFI offered an ESG course. I was super thrilled to learn so many new skill sets and topic areas.
Great illustration of the potential for ESG to impact a business. Incorporating a holistic view to complement the initiatives proposed and sensible assumptions with a high degree of prudence as to the positive ESG impact on WACC and employee and customer behaviour.
The course really helped me in understanding the various ESG factors that may affect the decisions and have an impact on its stakeholders.

What Our Students Say

Exposed me to Business Intelligence concepts I previously had little knowledge about. The courses are so engaging, interesting and practical that I had to go through it twice before taking the test.
This was one of the best if not the best online course I’ve taken with CFI. I’m glad I could build such an advanced dashboard while understanding more concepts in Tableau.
As a regular Power BI user, I found the content of this course intuitive to follow. Important concepts were divulged in-depth, with a highlight on best practices.
This course further solidified my grasp of Tableau by introducing complex visuals that are applicable to real-world corporate applications intuitively.
The practice exercises for each section grounded the recently learnt material. The visualization cheat sheet is not only a time-saver, but a useful check on my understanding of related concepts.
A lot of practical examples of using various features in both PowerBI and Excel Cube formulas.
Extremely interactive and easy to follow even for a person with 0 knowledge of SQL. Great how the instructor linked to other software as well, enhancing knowledge and applicability.
I love how brief the courses are and how easy they are to comprehend. I also appreciate that it is freely accessible from all over the world.
I love how organized this course is. The content is informative and easy to understand. I now have in-depth knowledge of BI after this course.
The end of chapter exercises are absolutely engaging and facilitate a more comprehensive learning experience.
Lots of practice from everyday analyst’s responsibilities, that is extremely valuable while learning SQL.

Love that I could understand the terms and processes, not having any prior knowledge of Real Estate.
Introduced us to unique considerations in modeling the real estate industry, including differences in sale and construction timelines, maximum land loans, and tiered waterfall equity. These considerations can be complex, but the course introduces these concepts in a digestible way.
I specialized in real estate management as part of my undergraduate degree but this course still exposed me to a variety of topics I needed clarification on. Highly informative and I will be recommending this course to my colleagues.
My understanding of real estate financial modelling has been improved a lot. Easy to follow and includes great templates as well.

What Our Members Say
FMVA certification is challenging, robust and interesting that equips an accounting/finance professional with world-class skills set to advance their careers excel in their endeavors!
This course was very detailed and structured. I would definitely recommend this Certification for any budding Financial Analyst.
I believe the program fully performs what it promises, bridging the gap between work and higher education. For me it means an added value that I cannot describe in words. The program focuses on technical knowledge, which is highly valued since, on average, a student only learns theory before starting work.
Strongly recommend to everyone who wants to receive new careers opportunities and enhance their knowledge in finance. CFI FMVA is perfect opportunity for everyone to obtain neccessary and strong background in financial modeling and valuation of companies. CFI helped me a lot with providing a financial aid and now my profile as a finance specialist is much more attractive and I receive additional confidence in my valuation skills. Thanks to everybody in the CFI team for creating such brilliant courses.
The resources are very educational and will go a long way not only for me but also for our colleagues in the energy regulatory agency. I appreciate very much the CFI material!
Big thank you to Tim Vipond for this incredible course. After much hard work, I now possess valuable financial modeling capabilities such as building discounted cash flow models, building dynamically linked 3-statement models, and building multi-year forecasts to project income statements, cash flows, and balance sheets into the future. In addition, I can draw upon multiple methods of financial and valuation analysis (including ratio analysis, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, accretion/dilution analysis, comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and discounted cash flow analysis) in order to assess the risks and rewards of investment opportunities.
Highly recommend the FMVA to everyone including people already in relevant careers who want to maximize their productivity or finance undergrads before they start their IB internships and want to make an impression.
This is a no-brainer for anyone still using their mouse in Excel.
I am honored to be amongst the other certified holders and I am excited to put into practice the many things I learnt from this program.
This experience has refined the way I build my financial models, with the added bonus of learning how to apply scenario and sensitivity analysis to answer what if questions.
Someone with no finance or accounting background can take this program and will not have any difficulties grasping the concepts.
The skills are actual real-world skills (unlike most financial qualifications) that have already helped me land a new role.
I would absolutely recommend CFI’s training for anyone who’s looking to rapidly increase their ability to add value through a certification program.
The FMVA program is the best professional certification course I have ever done. The course is hands on experience with relevant industry examples.
CFI’s FMVA is the epitome of practical financial analysis and with it, you do not need years of practice to know the content. You are fully baked by the time you finish the course.
