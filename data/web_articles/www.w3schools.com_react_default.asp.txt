Learn React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.
Learning by Examples
Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React. It shows both the code and the result.
Example:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);
