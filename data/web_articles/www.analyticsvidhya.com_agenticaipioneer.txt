Frequently asked questions
Looking for answers to other questions?
AI agents are autonomous systems designed to sense their environment, process information, and perform actions to achieve specific goals. They function by leveraging AI techniques like machine learning, natural language processing, and decision-making algorithms to automate or assist with tasks. You’ll learn about the role of agents in the AI ecosystem and their real-world applications in the Introduction to Generative AI module.
AI agents are classified into five types based on their complexity and interaction with the environment: Simple Reflex Agents: Follow predefined rules to respond to stimuli. Model-Based Reflex Agents: Use internal models to predict outcomes. Goal-Based Agents: Make decisions aimed at achieving specific objectives. Utility-Based Agents: Evaluate and optimize outcomes for maximum utility. Learning Agents: Improve their performance through experience. These types are discussed in detail in the Agents and Their Applications module.
Yes, ChatGPT is an AI agent specializing in conversational tasks. It uses advanced natural language processing capabilities to understand queries and provide human-like responses, making it a versatile tool for automating communication. The Exploring LLMs module explains how conversational agents like ChatGPT utilize large language models effectively.
