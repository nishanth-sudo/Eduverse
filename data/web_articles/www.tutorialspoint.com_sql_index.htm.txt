SQL Tutorial
OurSQL tutorialhelps you learn SQL (Structured Query Language) in simple and easy steps so that you can start your database programming quickly. It covers most of the important concepts related to SQL for a basic to advanced understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how SQL works.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language which is used to manage data stored in relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc.
SQLis a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc.SQLstands forStructured Query Language. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM Computer Scientists.
SQL Examples
Consider we have following CUSTOMERS table which stores customer's ID, Name, Age, Salary, City and Country −
ID
Name
Age
Salary
City
Country
1
Ramesh
32
2000.00
Maryland
USA
2
Mukesh
40
5000.00
New York
USA
3
Sumit
45
4500.00
Muscat
Oman
4
Kaushik
25
2500.00
Kolkata
India
5
Hardik
29
3500.00
Bhopal
India
6
Komal
38
3500.00
Saharanpur
India
7
Ayush
25
3500.00
Delhi
India
SQL makes it easy to manipulate this data using simple DML (Data Manipulation Language) Statements. For example, if we want to list down all the customers from USA then following will be the SQL query.
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE country = 'USA';
This will produce the following result:
ID
Name
Age
Salary
City
Country
1
Ramesh
32
2000.00
Maryland
USA
2
Mukesh
40
5000.00
New York
USA
SQL Online Editor
We have providedSQL Online Editorwhich helps you  toEditandExecutethe SQL code directly from your browser. Try to click the iconto run the following SQL code to be executed onCUSTOMERStable and print the records matching with the given condition.
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE country = 'USA';
So now, you do not need to do a sophisticated setup to execute all the examples given in this tutorial because we are providing youOnline SQL Editor, which allows you to edit your code and compile it online. You can try ourOnline SQL Editor.
SQL Basic Commands
We have a list of standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases, These commands are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE and can be classified into the following groups based on their nature −
Data Definition Language (DDL)
A Data Definition Language (DDL) is a computer language which is used to create and modify the structure of database objects which include tables, views, schemas, and indexes etc.
Command
Description
Demo

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
A Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a computer programming language which is used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database.
Command
Description
Demo
SELECT
Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.
Demo
INSERT
Creates a record.
Demo
UPDATE
Modifies records.
Demo
DELETE
Deletes records.
Demo
Data Control Language (DCL)
Data Control Language (DCL) is a computer programming language which is used to control access to data stored in a database.
Command
Description
Demo
GRANT
Gives a privilege to user
Demo
REVOKE
Takes back privileges granted from user.

Why to Learn SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a MUST for the students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. SQL is the most common language used almost in every application software including banking, finance, education, security etc. to store and manipulate data.
SQL is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then it is very much advised that you should also learn SQL and other Database related concepts to become a complete Software Programmer. There are many good reasons which makes SQL as the first choice of any programmer −
SQL is the standard language for any Relational Database System. All the Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
Also, software industry is using different dialects of SQL, such as −
MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
Oracle using PL/SQL,
Oracle using PL/SQL,
MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.
MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.
SQL Applications
SQL is one of the most widely used Query Language over the databases. SQL provides following functionality to the database programmers −
Execute different database queries against a database.

Frequently Asked Questions about SQL
There are some very Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ) about SQL, this section tries to answer them briefly.
SQL skills help software programmers and data experts maintain, create and retrieve information from relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server etc., which store data into columns and rows. It also allows them to access, update, manipulate, insert and modify data in efficient way.
A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values.
There are 5 main types of commands. DDL (Data Definition Language) commands, DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands, and DCL (Data Control Language) commands, Transaction Control Language(TCL) commands and Data Query Language(DQL) commands.
SQL is very easy to learn. You can learn SQL in as little as two to three weeks. However, it can take months of practice before you feel comfortable using it. Determining how long it takes to learn SQL also depends on how you plan to use it. Following this SQL tutorial will give you enough confidence to work on any software development related to database.
SQL queries are also more flexible and powerful than Excel formulas and SQL is fast which can handle large amount of data. Unlike Excel, SQL can handle well over one million fields of data with ease.
