What Students Say
GFG notes were instrumental in my success. Their concise yet comprehensive content made studying efficient and effective. I found clarity on complex topics, boosting my understanding and confidence. Grateful for such invaluable resources.
Daram Vishnu Vardhan
GATE AIR 2340
I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude for the invaluable role Geeks for Geeks (GFG) Mentors played in helping me crack the GATE DATA SCI 2024 exam and secure an All India Rank (AIR) of 288. A Big Thank You to GFG Mentors: A special thanks goes out to the GFG Mentors for their exceptional teaching. Their clear and in-depth explanations for Discrete Mathematics and Engineering Mathematics provided a rock-solid foundation that I couldn't have achieved anywhere else. The mentors' teaching truly stands out compared to other platforms I explored. The Importance of Maths, Bhai! As someone who scored a whopping 800 in CS, I firmly believe that mastering Maths is absolutely crucial for GATE success. Many platforms tend to overlook this important section, which carries a weight of nearly 13 marks! Geeks for Geeks: A One-Stop Shop Beyond Maths, Geeks for Geeks became my one-stop shop for GATE preparation. The user-friendly interface and the treasure trove of high-quality materials on Data Structures & Algorithms (the highest scoring subject in CS) were immensely helpful. In fact, I even used the platform to clarify doubts I had during my past college projects. The detailed explanations for subjects like Operating Systems and Computer Networks further strengthened my grasp of the concepts. Test Series that Packed a Punch I also want to give a big shout out to the Geeks for Geeks test series. The focus on truly understanding the concepts, along with the inclusion of technical numerical problems, made them exceptional tools for exam preparation. A Recommendation from the Heart Having explored a variety of platforms during my GATE journey, I can confidently say that Geeks for Geeks stands out as the most valuable resource. I highly recommend Geeks for Geeks to all future GATE aspirants out there. It will definitely give your preparation a big boost.

I am thrilled to share my success with GeeksforGeeks (GFG), which played a pivotal role in my GATE DA 2024 achievement. I have secured AIR 951 despite not having a strong CS background. GFG's Doubt Classes were invaluable, offering personalized assistance whenever needed. Their in-depth syllabus coverage ensured a strong conceptual understanding, while the abundance of practice problems sharpened my problem-solving skills effectively. Despite offering top-notch resources and high quality, GFG charges very less fees so that it does not become a burden for any of the students. I, Anant Om, highly recommend GFG to anyone aiming for GATE DA.
Anant Om
GATE AIR 951
I am incredibly grateful for GFG's Data Analytics (DA) course, especially since the DA paper was introduced for the first time this year. Finding proper course materials was a challenge, but GFG's DA course came to my rescue. Upon purchasing the course, I immediately realized that I had made the right choice. The course offered doubt clearing sessions, well-structured topics covering nearly everything, recorded lectures, and mock tests. These resources were invaluable in helping me understand the basics and gain practical experience with the types of questions likely to appear on the DA paper. One of the standout features of the course was the immediate provision of correct explanations for any wrong answers. This saved me a significant amount of time that would have otherwise been spent searching for explanations online. In summary, I am immensely thankful to GFG for creating such an exceptional course. I consider myself fortunate to have found it at the right time and believe that it played a crucial role in my success.

MAYUKH MAJUMDAR
GATE AIR 1856
I recently utilized geeksforgeeks to prepare for the GATE exam, and I must say, it was a valuable resource throughout my preparation journey. It significantly contributed to my success. The vast array of study materials, practice questions, and mock tests provided me with ample opportunities to strengthen my understanding of key concepts. I particularly appreciated the clarity and depth of explanations provided, which enabled me to grasp even the most challenging topics with ease. Particularly I found GATE LMN last minute notes to be useful to me. So do give them a try.

The GFG's CS/IT gate course was awesome, it was the only place from where I studied for GATE, my only regret is that If I could have bought the course earlier and might not be that busy with final year projects, seminars, and semesters, I surely could have secured even better rank. The course was completely comprehensive, properly structured, and had even mock test and practice sections. All in one, it was a complete package.

I was very undisciplined, so I needed some kind of framework, but I also study best at my own pace. The chapter wise recorded lectures helped me break down the portions into manageable chunks that motivated me to study instead of getting overwhelmed. I only studied theory from these lectures.it was well explained. Had I been more disciplined I could have taken advantage of the contest system and gotten a even better rank, but I am satisfied with this course even without getting the full value out of it.

I am thrilled to share my experience with the GFG GATE CS Course, as it played an instrumental role in helping me to achieve an impressive All India Rank of 1316 in the GATE CS 2024 exam with a gate score of 668. I started my preparation in September; I had only 5 months to prepare for GATE. At the time, I had no hope of getting such good marks. I have attended GFG's CIP course, so I knew that their courses are structured, and thus I decided to take the GATE CS self-paced course for my preparations. Before discovering this course, I was overwhelmed by the vast syllabus and intricate concepts of the GATE exam. However, the structured approach and comprehensive content provided by GeeksforGeeks helped me navigate through the complexities with confidence. One aspect that truly stood out was the depth of coverage across all topics. From fundamental concepts to advanced problem-solving techniques, every aspect of the syllabus was meticulously explained, leaving no room for doubt or confusion. The well-organized modules and practice exercises allowed me to reinforce my understanding and hone my skills effectively. There are also articles for every subject, which allowed me to make my notes short, and for deeper understanding while revising, I referred to articles. The PYQs for all the topics and chapters helped a lot while giving mock tests. I have given mock tests on various platforms to get diversity. These simulated exams not only helped me assess my progress but also equipped me with the strategies needed to tackle the actual exam confidently. I am immensely grateful to geeksforgeeks, for their unwavering support and commitment to helping students excel in their GATE endeavors. Thanks to their exceptional course, I was able to surpass my own expectations and secure a commendable rank in the GATE CS 2024 exam. I wholeheartedly recommend the geeksforgeeks GATE Course to any aspiring GATE candidate looking to achieve similar success.

For my DSA knowledge, GHG POTD helped me a lot. I practiced problems daily on the GFG Platform which helped me to build a logical and competitive mindset. Even on the day before the exam I did solve the POTD. Also, the plethora of libraries for Machine learning and Data Science helped me a lot.

GATE AIR 2041
My first attempt was a mediocre one and I just prepared around 3-4 subjects from geeks for geeks and was able to score way above qualifying marks, thanks to the quality content for geeks for geeks! This year, I have even more time to prepare for gate 2025 and this time, I’m sure of scoring below 500 rank and top score by finishing all the subjects!

Web Technology
Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication between different types of devices over the Internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as programs that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers.
Web Technology can be Classified into the Following Sections:
World Wide Web (WWW):The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Web Browser:The web browser is an application software to access and interactWorldWideWeb. It provides an interface between the server and the client, sending requests to the server for web documents and services.
Web Pages:A webpage is a digital document that is linked to the World Wide Web and viewable by anyone connected to the internet who has a web browser.
Web Server:A Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Web Development:Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet, i.e., websites.
Web Development can be Classified into Two Ways:
Frontend Development:The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.
Backend Development:The Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see or interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.
Frontend Development Languages
The front-end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:
HTML:HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
CSS:Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
JavaScript:JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and web-based software.
AJAX:Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. It is used to communicate with the server without refreshing the web page and thus increasing the user experience and better performance.
There are many other languages through which one can do front-end development depending upon the framework for exampleFlutteruserDart,ReactusesJavaScriptandDjangousesPython, and much more.
Backend Development Languages
The back end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:
PHP:PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
Node.js:Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Wallmart, and so on.
Python:Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
Ruby:Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Ruby is a pure Object-Oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Everything in Ruby is an object except the blocks but there are replacements too for it i.e procs and lambda. The objective of Ruby’s development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery.
Java:Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available.
JavaScript:JavaScript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming.
Golang:Golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to C programming language. Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language.
C#:C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C sharp”.
DBMS:The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS).
Databases
In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats. They enable web applications to handle dynamic content, user data, transactions, and more by providing efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation capabilities. Database management systems (DBMS) are used to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.
There are basically two types of databases:
1. SQL/Relational Database
A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.
MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used in web applications.
Postgre SQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for its reliability and extensibility.
MariaDB:MariaDB is an open-source relational database that evolved from MySQL, offering improved performance, security, and features. It supports SQL queries, ACID compliance, and is highly compatible with MySQL.
2. NoSQL Databases
A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications.
Mongodb:MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for flexible, scalable applications.
Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Redis: Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging.
Data Format
Format of data is used by web applications to communicate with each other. It is light weight text based data interchange format which means, it is simpler to read and write.
Below are two common data formats used in web development:
XML:Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
JSON:JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring data.
API:API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them.
Web Protocols
Web protocols are set of rules followed by everyone communicating over the web.
HTTP:The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.
Other Protocols:TCP/IP ModelUDPFTPSMTPSOAP
TCP/IP Model
UDP
FTP
SMTP
SOAP
Graphics
Graphical elements are one of the key feature of any webpage. They can be used to convey important points better than text does and beautify the webpage.
Canvas:The HTML “canvas” element is used to draw graphics via JavaScript.
SVG:SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It basically defines vector-based graphics in XML format.

C Programming Language Tutorial
C is a general-purpose, procedural, and middle-level programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is also known as the "mother of all programming languages" as it influenced many modern programming languages like C++, Java, Python, and Go.
Why learn C?
The C language is a popular choice for system-level and application programming due to its powerful, efficient, and flexible nature. Below are some key features of C language that show the ability and power of the C language:
Simple and Direct:C is a simple language with a small set of keywords due to which programmers have to take manual approach which provides a deeper understanding of how different concepts work at a low level.
Fast Speed:C is a statically typed compiler-based language so it is faster that other languages such as Python.
Memory Management:C provides direct access to lower-level memory management using pointers and functions like realloc(), free(), etc.
Structure Similarity:Many programming languages have borrowed their syntax from C language, so it is easy to learn them if you already know C.
C Fundamentals
This section of the C Tutorial includes basic concepts that build the foundation for writing C programs. It teaches you how to store and output data, perform arithmetic and other operations, control the program flow, etc.

Java Tutorial
Javais a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build applications across platforms—from web and mobile apps to enterprise software. It is known for itsWrite Once, Run Anywherecapability, meaning code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Java shares similarities with other C-based languages likeC++and C#, especially in terms of syntax and structure. Its robustness, cross-platform compatibility, and strong memory management have made it a go-to language for developers worldwide for over two decades.
ThisJava tutorialis designed for bothbeginnersandexperienced professionals, covering basic to advanced Java topics.
What is Java Used For?
Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language:
Used to developmobile apps,desktop apps,web apps,web servers,games, andenterprise-level systems.
Java was invented byJames GoslingandOraclecurrently owns it.JDK 23is the latest version of Java.
Java's syntax is similar to C/C++.
Popular platforms likeLinkedIn, Amazon,andNetflixrely on Java for their back-end architecture, showcasing its stability and scalability across different environments.
Popularity is so high that3 Billion+ devices use Javaacross the world.
Java Hello World Program
// A Java program to print "Hello World"publicclassGeeks{publicstaticvoidmain(Stringargs[]){System.out.println("Hello World");}}// Output:"Hello World"
// A Java program to print "Hello World"publicclassGeeks{publicstaticvoidmain(Stringargs[]){System.out.println("Hello World");}}// Output:"Hello World"
Java File Naming Conventions
When writing a Java program, we should follow the below rules:
The file name must match with the the Public class name.
Java is case sensitive, soGeeks.javais not equal togeeks.java.
If a file has no "public" class, the file name can be anything but it should be matched with the primary class name.

Web Development
Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from web design to programming and database management. Web development is generally divided into three core areas: Frontend Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development.
Frontend Development
Frontend development refers to everything that users see and interact with on the website. It involves the design, structure, and layout of the website and is often referred to as the ‘client side’ of an application.
Frontend Technologies
HTML:HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages, defining their structure and layout.
CSS:Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.
JavaScript:JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.
Frontend Frameworks/Libraries
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
Angular: A full-fledged framework for building single-page applications (SPAs), with features like two-way data binding and dependency injection.
Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework that is flexible and can be used for building both simple and complex user interfaces.
Backend Development
Backend development refers to the server side of a website, where the logic and data are processed and stored. Users do not directly interact with this part, but it ensures that the website works properly.
Server-side Programming Languages and Frameworks
PHP:PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
Java:Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable.
Python:Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
Node.js:Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
Ruby:Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.
C#:C# is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.

Full Stack Development
Full-stack development refers to the practice of developing both the frontend and backend of a website or web application. Full-stack developers have a deep understanding of both areas and can build end-to-end solutions.
Full Stack Technologies:
MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js
JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, Markup
Django Stack:Django, MySQL/PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Spring Boot Stack:Spring Boot, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Java
LAMP Stack:Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
LEMP Stack: Linux, Engine-X, MySQL, PHP
Databases
In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats. They enable web applications to handle dynamic content, user data, transactions, and more by providing efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation capabilities. Database management systems (DBMS) are used to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.
1. Relational Databases
A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.
Postgre SQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for its reliability and extensibility.
MariaDB: MariaDB is an open-source relational database that evolved from MySQL, offering improved performance, security, and features. It supports SQL queries, ACID compliance, and is highly compatible with MySQL.
MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used in web applications.
2. NoSQL Databases
A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications.
Mongodb: MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for flexible, scalable applications.
Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Redis: Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging.
