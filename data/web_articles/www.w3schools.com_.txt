Responsive Web Design -Introduction
What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript.
Designing For The Best Experience For All Users
Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones.
Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device.
Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device:
It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.

Colors Tutorial
Colors are displayed combining RED, GREEN, and BLUE light.
Color Names
With CSS, colors can be set by using color names:
Example
CSS Color Values
With CSS, colors can be specified in different ways:
By color names
As RGB values
As hexadecimal values
As HSL values (CSS3)
As HWB values (CSS4)
With thecurrentcolorkeyword
currentcolor
RGB Colors
RGB color values are supported in all browsers.
An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(RED,GREEN,BLUE).
Each parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
For example, rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, 
because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
Example
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:
Example
Hexadecimal Colors
Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.
A hexadecimal color is specified with:
#RRGGBB.
RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and 
FF specifying the intensity of the color.
For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 
00.
Example
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:
Example
Upper Case or Lower Case?
You can use upper case or lower case letters to specify hexadecimal values.
Lower case are easier to write. Upper case are easier to read.
Color Names
CSS supports 140 standard color names.
In the next chapter you will find a complete alphabetical list of color names 
with hexadecimal values:
The currentcolor Keyword
Thecurrentcolorkeyword refers to the value of the color property of an element.
currentcolor
Example
The border color of the following <div> element will be blue, because the 
 text color of the <div> element is blue:

Learn SVG
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format.
SVG graphics are scalable, and do not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized.
SVG is supported by all major browsers.
Examples in Each Chapter
With our "Try it Yourself" editor, you can edit the SVG, and click on a button to view the result.
SVG Example
What you should already know
Before you continue, you should have a basic understanding of the following:
HTML
Basic XML
If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on ourHome page.
What is SVG?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
SVG defines graphics in XML format
Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated
SVG is a W3C recommendation
SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM, XSL and JavaScript
SVG is a W3C Recommendation
SVG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 4 September 2001.
SVG 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on 14 January 2003.
SVG 1.1 (Second Edition) became a W3C Recommendation on 16 August 2011.
SVG Advantages
Advantages of using SVG over other image formats (like JPEG 
and GIF) are:
SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor
SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed
SVG images are scalable
SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution
SVG images are zoomable
SVG graphics do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized

How does it Work?
SVG has elements and attributes for rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, 
polygons, curves, and more.
SVG also supports filter and blur effects, gradients, rotations, animations, 
interactivity with JavaScript, and more.
A simple SVG document consists of the <svg> root element and several basic 
shape elements that will build a graphic together.
Creating SVG Images
SVG images can be created with any text editor, or with a drawing program, likeInkscape.
For you to learn the concept and basics of SVG, this tutorial will just use 
plain text to teach you SVG.
The next page shows how to embed an SVG image directly into an HTML page!
