In this hands-on workshop, participants will explore the cutting-edge world of Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and building autonomous AI agents. Combining theory with hands-on coding examples, this session is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of how to build, train, and fine-tune an LLM for specific applications as well as how to increase their utility with RAG and AI Agents.

New to the world of Agentic AI and want to quickly get proficient in the key aspects of learning, building, deploying and monitoring Agentic AI Systems? This is the workshop for you! In this workshop you will get a comprehensive coverage of the breadth as well as deep dive into the depth of the vast world of Agentic AI Systems. Over the course of six modules, you will spend the entire day focusing on the following key areas:
Learn essential concepts of Generative AI, Agentic AI and Agentic RAG Systems
Deep dive into industry standard design patterns for architecting Agentic AI Systems - Tool-Use, Reflection, Planning, Multi-Agent
Leverage Industry-Standard frameworks including LangChain, LangGraph and CrewAI to build simple and advanced Agentic AI & Agentic RAG Systems
Learn basics of how to deploy Agentic AI Systems as APIs as well as debug and monitor them
While we want to keep the discussions as framework and tool-agnostic as possible, since 90% of the workshop will be hands-on focused; we will be using LangChain and LangGraph (currently the leading framework used in the industry)¬† for most of the hands-on demos for building Agents and also a bit of CrewAI. While the focus of the workshop is more on building Agentic AI Systems we will also showcase how you can build a basic web service or API on top of an Agent using FastAPI and deploy and monitor it using frameworks like LangFuse or Arize AI Phoenix.
Important Note:You may need to register for some platforms like Tavily, WeatherAPI etc for the workshop (no billing needed), we will send the instructions ahead of time. That will be essential for running the hands-on code demos live along with the instructor in the session.
Additional Points
Prerequisites:Solid understanding of Python, NLP and Generative AI will be useful
Content Provided:Slides, complete code notebooks, datasets
Infrastructure:Most of the hands-on demos we will do on Google Colab for the deployment and monitoring section we will provide the cloud infrastructure (either Colab or Runpod.io).
*Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.

Agentic RAG adds a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù to the RAG pipeline ‚Äì bringing reasoning, tool use, and adaptiveness ‚Äì which translates to tangible business value in accuracy, flexibility, and user trust
This workshop is a deep dive intoAgentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)‚Äì an emerging approach that combines the power of LLM-based agents with retrieval techniques to build smarter AI applications. Over an 8-hour session (of course including breaks in between), participants will explore how to move beyond ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù RAG pipelines and infuse them with agentic behavior for greater flexibility and intelligence. The workshop ishands-on, using Google Colab notebooks for each module so attendees can practice concepts live. We‚Äôll leverageLangGraph(a LangChain-based framework for agent orchestration) along with the LangChain ecosystem (vector stores, tools, etc.) to design and implement these systems. The theme is highly relevant in today‚Äôs AI landscape ‚Äì many enterprises are already moving from basic RAG to agent-driven systems to power next-generation assistants. In fact, new frameworks like LangGraph have emerged to meet this need, making now the perfect time to master Agentic RAG development. The workshop will also cover practical tips for building enterprise-grade agentic RAG applications
Big Business Benefits of Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG empowers large-scale, enterprise-ready AI systems by combining retrieval-augmented generation with intelligent, decision-making agents. The result? Smarter, more reliable, and adaptable GenAI solutions.
Higher Accuracy & Trust: Agents reason through queries, validate retrieved information, and reduce hallucinations ‚Äì essential for business-critical use cases.
Dynamic Multi-Source Retrieval: Unlike traditional RAG limited to one vector DB, agents can pull context from multiple sources‚Äîinternal files, databases, APIs, or the web‚Äîdynamically.
Autonomous Problem Solving: Agentic systems can break down complex queries, reformulate them, and perform multi-step retrieval and reasoning with minimal human intervention.
Scalable & Adaptable: Agent orchestration supports modular workflows that scale across domains, datasets, and tools‚Äîmaking the solution extensible and future-proof.
üí°Think of Agentic RAG as adding a decision-making brain to your RAG pipeline‚Äîboosting precision, flexibility, and business value.
*Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.
Arun Prakash Asokan
Associate Director Data Science
09:30AM - 05:30PM
This workshop introduces AgentOps, a subcategory of GenAIOps, which focuses on the operationalization of AI agents. It dives into how we can create, manage, and scale generative AI agents effectively within production environments. You‚Äôll learn the essential principles of AgentOps, from external tool integration and memory management to task orchestration, multi-agent systems, and Agentic RAG. By the end of the workshop, participants will have the skills to build and deploy intelligent agents that can automate complex tasks, handle multi-step processes, and operate within enterprise environments.
*Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.

In this workshop, we‚Äôll build a fully functional multimodal Telegram agent, putting into practice a wide range of concepts from the world of Agentic AI. This isn‚Äôt just another PoC ‚Äî it's designed for those who are ready to level up and build complex, production-ready agentic applications.
Throughout the session, you‚Äôll learn how to build a Telegram agent you can chat with directly from your phone, master the creation and management of workflows with LangGraph, and set up a long-term memory system using Qdrant as a vector database.
We‚Äôll also leverage the fast Groq LLMs to power the agent‚Äôs responses, implement Speech-to-Text capabilities with Whisper, and integrate Text-to-Speech using ElevenLabs.
Beyond language, you‚Äôll learn to generate high-quality images using diffusion models, and process visual inputs with Vision-Language Models such as Llama 3.2 Vision.
Finally, we‚Äôll bring it all together by connecting the complete agentic application directly to Telegram, enabling a rich, multimodal user experience.
