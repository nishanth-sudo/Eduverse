Learn MongoDB
MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON.
If you are unfamiliar with JSON, check out ourJSON tutorial.
A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs similar to the structure of JSON objects.
A MongoDB Document
Records in a MongoDB database are called documents, and the field values may include numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or even nested documents.
Example Document
{
	title: "Post Title 1",
	body: "Body of post.",
	category: "News",
	likes: 1,
	tags: ["news", "events"],
	date: Date()
}
{
	title: "Post Title 1",
	body: "Body of post.",
	category: "News",
	likes: 1,
	tags: ["news", "events"],
	date: Date()
}

Our "Show MongoDB" tool makes it easy to demonstrate MongoDB. It shows both the code and the result.
Example
Find all documents that have a category of "news".
db.posts.find( {category: "News"} )
db.posts.find( {category: "News"} )
