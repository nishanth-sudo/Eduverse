Frequently Asked Questions about PHP
There are some very Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ) about PHP, this section tries to answer them briefly.
PHP is that's relatively easy to learn, even for beginners with little or no programming experience. To learn PHP, one needs to only have a basic understanding of computer programming, Internet, database, and HTML. However, prior knowledge of any one programming knowledge is an additional advantage. After learning the core PHP, you can the become proficient in any PHP web framework suitable for the development of applications, such as WordPress, Laravel etc.
As PHP is open-source, it is free to use. You can also freely distribute the applications built with PHP. The PHP license under which the PHP scripting language is released, implies that, The PHP code can be redistributed in source or binary form. It also means its use and its many libraries and frameworks can be used for both commercial and private use.
PHP is a server-side scripting language, optimized especially for building dynamic web applications. Developers use PHP to develop applications like content management systems, blogging applications, E-commerce applications, REST APIs etc. A number of PHP frameworks have been developed that are suitable for building applications of a specific type.  For example, WordPress is used for building business websites and blogs. Similarly, Laravel is used in E-commerce platforms, Social networking apps, and CRM systems.
To run a PHP application, you need a server, a database server, and a PHP parser software. The most preferred combination is an Apache server, MySQL database, and a PHP module. While one can install all these components individually and configure them, the easiest way is to install  pre-compiled binaries bundled together. Examples are XAMPP, WAMP and LAMP.
XAMPP is a cross-platform and open-source web server stack package developed by Apache Friends. It consists of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database (an open-source fork of MySQL), and interpreters fo PHP and Perl. The XAMPP software Cn be downloaded fromhttps://www.apachefriends.org/download.html.
PHP is a server-side scripting language, that is optimized for building dynamic web applications. One or more blocks of PHP script can be embedded inside HTML code. PHP works seamlessly with HTML and JavaScript to manage the frontend tasks of a web application. Although you can use any database, PHP is most commonly used along with a MySQL database as a backend of a web application. PHP developers also use technologies such as CSS, Ajax, Bootstrap etc. for the development of web applications.
The frontend of a typical web application deals with the design aspect. HTML, JavaScript and CSS technologies are mainly used as the frontend tools. PHP on the other hand is a server-side programming language. It is used to prepare algorithms for handling the processing logic, interacting with the databases, and handling the security aspects. Hence, it can be said that PHP is primarily used for backend development.
PHP, like any other server-side technology is likely to be affected by security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site attacks and cross-site forgery. As a PHP developer, it is important to take all the necessary precautions.
PHP language has been constantly evolving. In its latest version  PHP 8, a lot of new features have been provided.
The JIT (Just in Time) compiler is one of the most important features that has enhanced the efficiency of PHP.
The OPcache feature also improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in shared memory.
PHP 8 has also introduced new features such as named arguments to function, Union types and more.
The amount of time it takes to learn PHP varies from person to person. To learn PHP Basics it may take 1-2 months. To get Intermediate Skills, and additional period of 2-3 months may be needed to mater the OOP concepts, and PHP frameworks, and building more complex projects. Learning PHP is an ongoing process, where you can add proficiency in enhancing security, performance, and keeping up with PHP trends.
The official documentation of PHP (https://www.php.net/docs.php) provides the detailed coverage of PHP's keywords, built-in functions and other features along with useful examples. The PHP tutorial from TutorialsPoint (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/index.htm) is an extremely useful resources for beginners who want to learn PHP. TutorialsPoint also provides video-based tutorials and certifications to master PHP.
