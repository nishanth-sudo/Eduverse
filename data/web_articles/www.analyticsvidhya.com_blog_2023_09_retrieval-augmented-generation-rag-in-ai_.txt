What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, represents a cutting-edge approach toartificial intelligence(AI) andnatural language processing(NLP). At its core, RAG LLM is an innovative framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, revolutionizing how AI systems understand and generate human-like text.
Why Use RAG?
The development of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a direct response to the limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. While LLMs have shown impressive text generation capabilities, they often struggle to provide contextually relevant responses, hindering their utility in practical applications. RAG LLM aims to bridge this gap by offering a solution that understands user intent and delivers meaningful and context-aware replies.
The Fusion of Retrieval-Based and Generative Models
RAG is fundamentally a hybrid model that seamlessly integrates two critical components. Retrieval-based methods involve accessing and extracting information from external knowledge sources such as databases, articles, or websites.
On the other hand, generative models excel in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. What distinguishes RAG Model is its ability to harmonize these two components, creating a symbiotic relationship that allows it to comprehend user queries deeply and produce responses that are not just accurate but also contextually rich.
Deconstructing RAG’s Mechanics
To grasp the essence of RAG LLM, it’s essential to deconstruct its operational mechanics. RAG operates through a series of well-defined steps:
Begin by receiving and processing user input.
Analyze the user input to understand its meaning and intent.
Utilize retrieval-based methods to access external knowledge sources. This enriches the understanding of the user’s query.
Use the retrieved external knowledge to enhance comprehension.
Employ generative capabilities to craft responses. Ensure responses are factually accurate, contextually relevant, and coherent.
Combine all the information gathered to produce responses that are meaningful and human-like.
Ensure that the transformation of user queries into responses is done effectively.
The Role of Language Models and User Input
Central to understanding RAG is appreciating the role ofLarge Language Models (LLMs)in AI systems. LLMs like GPT are the backbone of many NLP applications, including chatbots and virtual assistants. They excel in processing user input and generating text, but their accuracy and contextual awareness are paramount for successful interactions. RAG strives to enhance these essential aspects by integrating retrieval and generation.
Incorporating External Knowledge Sources
RAG’s distinguishing feature is its ability to integrate external knowledge sources seamlessly. By drawing from vast information repositories, RAG augments its understanding, enabling it to provide well-informed and contextually nuanced responses. Incorporating external knowledge elevates the quality of interactions and ensures that users receive relevant and accurate information.
Generating Contextual Responses
Ultimately, RAG’s hallmark is its ability to generate contextual responses. Moreover, it considers the broader context of user queries, leverages external knowledge, and produces responses demonstrating a deep understanding of the user’s needs. Consequently, these context-aware responses are a significant advancement, as they facilitate more natural and human-like interactions, making AI systems powered by RAG highly effective in various domains.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a transformative concept in AI and NLP. Additionally, by harmonizing retrieval and generation components, RAG addresses the limitations of existing language models and paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware AI interactions. Furthermore, its ability to seamlessly integrate external knowledge sources and generate responses that align with user intent positions RAG as a game-changer in developing AI systems that can truly understand and communicate with users in a human-like manner.
Range of Data Sources to Empower RAG Models
In this section, we delve into the pivotal role of external data sources within the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We explore the diverse range of data sources that can be harnessed to empower RAG-driven models.
APIs and Real-time Databases
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and real-time databases are dynamic sources that provide up-to-the-minute information to RAG-driven models. They also allow models to access the latest data as it becomes available.
Document Repositories
Document repositories serve as valuable knowledge stores, offering structured and unstructured information. Additionally, they are fundamental in expanding the knowledge base that RAG models can draw upon.
Webpages and Scraping
Web scraping is a method for extracting information from web pages. It enables RAG LLM models to access dynamic web content, making it a crucial source for real-time data retrieval.
Databases and Structured Information
Databases provide structured data that can be queried and extracted. Additionally, RAG models can utilize databases to retrieve specific information, enhancing their responses’ accuracy.
Benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Let us now talk about the benefits of Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG Model.
Enhanced LLM Memory
RAG addresses the information capacity limitation of traditional Language Models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs have a limited memory called “Parametric memory.” RAG introduces a “Non-Parametric memory” by tapping into external knowledge sources. This significantly expands the knowledge base of LLMs, enabling them to provide more comprehensive and accurate responses.
Improved Contextualization
RAG enhances the contextual understanding of LLMs by retrieving and integrating relevant contextual documents. This empowers the model to generate responses that align seamlessly with the specific context of the user’s input, resulting in accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.
Updatable Memory
A standout advantage of RAG is its ability to accommodate real-time updates and fresh sources without extensive model retraining. Moreover, this keeps the external knowledge base current and ensures that LLM-generated responses are always based on the latest and most relevant information.
Source Citations
RAG-equipped models can provide sources for their responses, thereby enhancing transparency and credibility. Moreover, users can access the sources that inform the LLM’s responses, promoting transparency and trust in AI-generated content.
Reduced Hallucinations
Studies have shown that RAG models exhibit fewer hallucinations and higher response accuracy. They are also less likely to leak sensitive information. Reduced hallucinations and increased accuracy make RAG models more reliable in generating content.
These benefits collectively make Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) a transformative framework in Natural Language Processing. Consequently, it overcomes the limitations of traditional language models and enhances the capabilities of AI-powered applications.

Web Data Loading for the RAG Knowledge Base
The code utilizes LangChain’s “WebBaseLoader.”
Three web pages are specified for data retrieval: YOLO-NAS object detection, DeciCoder’s code generation efficiency, and a Deep Learning Daily newsletter.
This step is essential for building the knowledge base used in RAG, enabling contextually relevant and accurate information retrieval and integration into language model responses.
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

yolo_nas_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/").load()

decicoder_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deci.ai/blog/decicoder-efficient-and-accurate-code-generation-llm/#:~:text=DeciCoder's%20unmatched%20throughput%20and%20low,re%20obsessed%20with%20AI%20efficiency.").load()

yolo_newsletter_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deeplearningdaily.substack.com/p/unleashing-the-power-of-yolo-nas").load()
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

yolo_nas_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/").load()

decicoder_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deci.ai/blog/decicoder-efficient-and-accurate-code-generation-llm/#:~:text=DeciCoder's%20unmatched%20throughput%20and%20low,re%20obsessed%20with%20AI%20efficiency.").load()

yolo_newsletter_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://deeplearningdaily.substack.com/p/unleashing-the-power-of-yolo-nas").load()
Split the Data into Chunks
We will use any text splitter to split the data into smaller chunks. Here we will use CharacterTextSplitter.
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
	separator="\n\n",
	chunk_size=500,
	chunk_overlap=0,
	is_separator_regex=False,)
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
	separator="\n\n",
	chunk_size=500,
	chunk_overlap=0,
	is_separator_regex=False,)
Let us apply the text_splitter for the data as below to split the data into chunks.
yolo_nas_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(yolo_nas_loader) 
decicoder_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(decicoder_loader)
yolo_newsletter_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(yolo_newsletter_loader)
yolo_nas_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(yolo_nas_loader) 
decicoder_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(decicoder_loader)
yolo_newsletter_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(yolo_newsletter_loader)
Embedding and Vector Store Setup
The code sets up embeddings for the RAG process.
It uses “OpenAIEmbeddings” to create an embedding model.
A “CacheBackedEmbeddings” object is initialized, allowing embeddings to be stored and retrieved efficiently using a local file store.
A “FAISS” vector store is created from the preprocessed chunks of web data (yolo_nas_chunks, decicoder_chunks, and yolo_newsletter_chunks), enabling fast and accurate similarity-based retrieval.
Finally, a retriever is instantiated from the vector store, facilitating efficient document retrieval during the RAG process.
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.cache import CacheBackedEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.storage import LocalFileStore

store = LocalFileStore("./cachce/")

# create an embedder
core_embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

embedder = CacheBackedEmbeddings.from_bytes_store(
    core_embeddings_model,
    store,
    namespace = core_embeddings_model.model
)

# store embeddings in vector store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(yolo_nas_chunks, embedder)

vectorstore.add_documents(decicoder_chunks)

vectorstore.add_documents(yolo_newsletter_chunks)

# instantiate a retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.cache import CacheBackedEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.storage import LocalFileStore

store = LocalFileStore("./cachce/")

# create an embedder
core_embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

embedder = CacheBackedEmbeddings.from_bytes_store(
    core_embeddings_model,
    store,
    namespace = core_embeddings_model.model
)

# store embeddings in vector store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(yolo_nas_chunks, embedder)

vectorstore.add_documents(decicoder_chunks)

vectorstore.add_documents(yolo_newsletter_chunks)

# instantiate a retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

Establishing the Retrieval System
The code configures the retrieval system for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain Expression Language Chains.
We will initialize ChatPromptTemplate using a prompt that is sent to the LLM.
It uses “ChatOpenAI” from the LangChain library to set up a chat-based Large Language Model (LLM).
The “rag_chain_from_docs” chain is created, incorporating the context, prompt and LLM.
The “rag_chain_with_source” chain is created, using retriever and rag_chain_from_docs.
This chain is designed to perform retrieval-based question-answering tasks, and it is configured to return source documents for added context during the RAG process.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableParallel

# this formats the docs returned by the retriever 
def format_docs(docs):
	return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

# prompt to send to the LLM
prompt = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
    	Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
    	If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.
    	Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

    	Question: {question}

    	Context: {context}

    	Answer:
    	"""

prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini', streaming=True)


# This code defines a chain where input documents are first formatted, then passed through a prompt template, and finally processed by an LLM.
rag_chain_from_docs = (
	RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs(x["context"])))
	| prompt_template
	| llm
	)
# This code creates a parallel process: one retrieves the context (using a retriever), and the other passes the question through unchanged. The results are then combined and assigned to the variable `answer` using the `rag_chain_from_docs` processing chain.
rag_chain_with_source = RunnableParallel(
	{"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
).assign(answer=rag_chain_from_docs)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableParallel

# this formats the docs returned by the retriever 
def format_docs(docs):
	return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

# prompt to send to the LLM
prompt = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
    	Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
    	If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.
    	Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

    	Question: {question}

    	Context: {context}

    	Answer:
    	"""

prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini', streaming=True)


# This code defines a chain where input documents are first formatted, then passed through a prompt template, and finally processed by an LLM.
rag_chain_from_docs = (
	RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs(x["context"])))
	| prompt_template
	| llm
	)
# This code creates a parallel process: one retrieves the context (using a retriever), and the other passes the question through unchanged. The results are then combined and assigned to the variable `answer` using the `rag_chain_from_docs` processing chain.
rag_chain_with_source = RunnableParallel(
	{"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
).assign(answer=rag_chain_from_docs)
Initializes the RAG System
The code sets up a RetrievalQA chain, a critical part of the RAG system, by combining an OpenAIChat language model (LLM) with a retriever and callback handler.
Issue Queries to the RAG System
It sends various user queries to the RAG system, prompting it to retrieve contextually relevant information.
Retrieves Responses
After processing the queries, the RAG system generates and returns contextually rich and accurate responses. The responses are printed on the console.
# This is to generate response with RAG system
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke(
	"What does Neural Architecture Search have to do with how Deci creates its models?")

print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
# This is to generate response with RAG system
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke(
	"What does Neural Architecture Search have to do with how Deci creates its models?")

print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke("What is DeciCoder")
print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke("What is DeciCoder")
print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke(
	"Write a blog about Deci and how it used NAS to generate YOLO-NAS and DeciCoder")
print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
response = rag_chain_with_source.invoke(
	"Write a blog about Deci and how it used NAS to generate YOLO-NAS and DeciCoder")
print(response['answer'].content)
print(response['context'])
