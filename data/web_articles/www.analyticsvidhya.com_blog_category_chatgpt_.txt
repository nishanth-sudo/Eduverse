ChatGPT
There was a time when books were the only source of information, and then Google came into the picture. However, with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), ChatGPT has become the go-to search space for most people.
But why ChatGPT?
ChatGPT has done wonders for writers, coders, and professionals from all aspects. Simply put, it cut short any long-forming process. It helps writers create articles, short content, and creative ideas as it speeds up the writing process. All in all, coders get a lot of use out of ChatGPT when it comes to generating code and offering suggestions or explaining how potential issues can be debugged. Alongside these,ChatGPTabets other industries by automating repetitive jobs, helping with research, and providing custom insights so that professionals can dedicate more time to making strategic and creative decisions.
Do you know…
According to a study by Amazon Web Services, 57% of content on the Internet today is generated using AI. According to a Forbes report, this number will likely reach 90% by 2025.
Now, you might know the definition of ChatGPT and why it is used, despite Let’s revisit the memory lane…
What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPTis an AI-powered conversational agent developed by OpenAI. It is based onGenerative AI, a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content by learning from large datasets of existing content.
ChatGPT is your go-to person with solutions to all your problems, but byGeneratingTEXT.
ChatGPT is aLarge Language Model (LLM)that uses a variant of theTransformer architectureto understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives.
ChatGPT, when asked to make a quote about itself:
“ChatGPT is a powerful language model that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with and utilize artificial intelligence in our daily lives. Its ability to generate human-like text allows it to assist with a wide range of tasks that involve language processing, making it a valuable tool for businesses, researchers, and individuals alike.”
Definition and Functionality
Fundamentally, ChatGPT is a text-processing tool that can take in textual inputs and generate coherent responses. Its versatility allows it to be used in many ways, such as answering questions, providing recommendations, summarizing texts, and simply generating content for many domains.
One of OpenAI’s descriptions of ChatGPT reads:
“ChatGPT is an AI model trained to follow instructions and provide detailed, coherent responses to user prompts. It leverages a large dataset of diverse text to simulate conversation.”
It is based on aGenerative Pretrained Transformer, a type ofdeep learningintroduced in 2018. Every follow-up model—GPT -2, GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-4o and soon-to-come GPT 5—has become bigger and better. These models are pre-trained on massivedatasetsfrom the internet and then fine-tuned for specific applications, allowing them to engage in interactive, context-sensitive dialogues.
Overview of Generative AI and ChatGPT
Source:OpenAI– It depicts how ChatGPT was trained
By generative AI, you can understand a system that produces new content with prompts (text, image, music, etc.). Generative models are a subset of AI models where the network goes beyond its normal classification or regression function to generate new data from what it has learned. Here’s an example: With ChatGPT, one of the state-of-the-artNatural Language Processing (NLP)tools, you can engage in incredibly natural and human-like conversations—sometimes even better than interacting with a real person.
As explained by OpenAI:
“Generative AI models like GPT are designed to predict the next word in a sequence, and by doing this repeatedly, they can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.”
Thesegenerative modelshave multiple applications in industries, from customer service automation to content creation and education. For instance, ChatGPT can assist with:
Customer Support: Acting as a virtual assistant, ChatGPT can handle inquiries, complaints, and service issues.
Writing and Editing: Generative AI can draft articles, create reports, and refine written material.
Coding Assistance: With an understanding of programming languages, ChatGPT can generate code snippets, help debug errors, or explain complex programming concepts.
Education: It helps explain complex concepts or summarize topics across academic fields.

GPT 3.5 vs GPT 4 vs GPT 4 Turbo
The differences between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo primarily revolve around their architecture, capabilities, and performance. Here’s a breakdown of each model:
Key differences
Memory:GPT-4 can remember and process up to 64,000 words, while GPT-3.5 handles up to 8,000 words.
Input Types:GPT-4 can process text and images, but GPT-3.5 can only process text.
Availability:GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo are available through subscriptions, while GPT-3.5 is free.
Customization:GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo allow fine-tuning for specific tasks, but GPT-3.5 doesn’t.
Capabilities:GPT-4 has better language understanding, multimodal abilities (text + images), and reliability than GPT-3.5.
Data-to-Text vs. Text-to-Text:GPT-4 models can generate responses from structured data (data-to-text), while GPT-3.5 only works with text-based inputs and outputs (text-to-text).
GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo represent significant advancements over GPT-3.5 in terms of memory capacity, input modalities, safety, customization, and overall performance. However, GPT-3.5 remains a powerful and widely accessible language model.
Model Architecture and Size
GPT-3.5:This model has around 175 billion parameters. The platform is tailored to everyday workloads and offers the perfect combination of performance and cost efficiency, which applies to many use cases.
GPT-4:This significantly larger model, estimated at around 1 trillion parameters, has a more advanced architecture that helps it better understand context and response. GPT-4 provides better long-range dependency handling than GPT-3.5, as it can handle up to 64,000 tokens, compared to GPT-3.5’s 8,000 tokens.
GPT-4 Turbo:This variant is optimized for efficiency, reducing inference time and costs. It is based on a larger context window of 128,000 tokens (allowing full packets as more status inputs) and has been designed to be cheaper than the GPT-4 model.
Capabilities of the Models
Text and Image Processing:Unlike GPT-3.5, which only handles text, GPT-4 can process both text and images. This makes it more useful for tasks involving understanding visual content and text.
Response Accuracy and Safety:GPT-4 has better contextual understanding, leading to more accurate responses. It is also 82% less likely thanGPT-3.5to generate inappropriate or disallowed content.
Plugins and Real-Time Data:GPT-4 can use plugins to access real-time information, a feature not available in GPT-3.5, making its responses more up-to-date and relevant.
User Experience and Cost Effectiveness
Speed and Cost:While GPT-3. 5 is naturally faster and more cost-effective, GPT-4 delivers a user experience with higher contextual capabilities than ever before. Regarding efficiency and cost, the GPT-4 Turbo is an informed choice, being more advanced than the GPT-3. 5.
Use Cases:GPT-3. 5 is still used for general computing because it spins more cheaply and quickly. GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, on the other hand, can help both write and understand at a deeper level for more complex tasks such as creative writing, detailed analysis, and interactive applications.

Managing Hallucinations in ChatGPT
Why It Happens: ChatGPT is probabilistic and sometimes creates fake or false information. Even when the model has been trained on a large dataset, it does not have any prior information about facts; in actuality, all this training did was teach the sequence of words that is most likely given its input, which can also be misleading and generate what are called hallucinations from confidence.
How to Mitigate:HallucinationsMitigation strategies include:Fine-tuning models on more specific, accurate datasets.Adding user prompts that explicitly ask for clarification or fact-based responses.Implementingretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)to cross-reference real-time information from external databases.

Prompt Engineering: Ask the model to provide sources or evidence for claims, which can help identify where the model might be uncertain or less reliable.
Human-in-the-Loop: Always having a human verify critical or sensitive information generated by the model.
Bias in ChatGPT Responses
