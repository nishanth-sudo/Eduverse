For all skill levels
Challenges start simple and gradually become more complex, helping students build confidence as they go.
Use pre-made or custom challenges
Choose between our pre-made challenges or make your own from scratch or with our AI generator.
Wide range of topics
Students can practice coding in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.
Instant feedback
Students see results right away, so they can test ideas, fix mistakes, and improve their logic faster.
Build problem solving skills
Code challenges are more than just tasks and requirements. Students get hands-on experience in breaking down problems and finding solutions.
A safe space to learn
Students are encouraged to test ideas, make mistakes, and learn from them. It's a supportive environment where trying is part of the learning process.
Check the code and make it better
Students get used to reviewing their code, finding mistakes, and making improvements. This helps them become more independent and confident coders.
Encourage critical thinking & problem-solving
Students learn to think critically and solve problems step by step.
Projects
Projects help students use what they've learned by creating coding solutions with clear goals and instructions. Each project has a structure to help students stay focused and build useful skills.
Create custom projects
Students can build their own projects from scratch and tailor them to match your teaching goals.
Encourage teamwork
Students can work independently or collaborate with classmates using shared cursors, comments, and discussions.
Choose from multiple languages
Students can build projects in languages like Python, PHP, JavaScript, and more.
As a teacher, you can create your own challenges and projects or choose from a selection of ready-made options.
Assign the activities
Create assignments by combining challenges and projects to assess student progress. You can assign them to a whole class or to individual students.
Integrated development environment
With W3Schools Spaces, the students can build and test directly in the browser, no setup required. It's an easy way for students to apply their skills, experiment with code, and share their work with others.
What educators say
Nesta Paul Katende
Founder & CEO in Otic Foundation
We chose W3Schools Academy because of its proven ability to deliver high-quality education. With clear, concise, and interactive tutorials, W3Schools makes learning accessible to everyone.
Brian Moran
Co-Founder in Boolean Girl
Boolean Girl was looking for a single platform to teach Python and Web development to students. We already used W3Schools as a reference platform in our teaching so it made sense to also use the development environment.
