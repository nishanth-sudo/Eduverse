Frequently Asked Questions
Dataset: Ensuring Quality and Safety in Training
TheImagen modelis trained using a large dataset that includes text, images, and related annotations. DeepMind used several filtration stages to guarantee quality and safety requirements. First, any images deemed dangerous, violent, or poor quality are removed. Next, DeepMind removed images created by AI to stop the model from picking up biases or artifacts frequently present in these kinds of images. DeepMind also employed down-weighting similar images and deduplication procedures to reduce the possibility of outputs overfitting certain training data points.
Every image in the dataset has a syntheticcaptionand an original caption derived from alt text, human descriptions, etc. Gemini models produce synthetic captions with different cues. To maximize the language diversity and quality of these synthetic captions, DeepMind used multiple Gemini models and instructions. DeepMind used various filters to eliminate potentially harmful captions and personally identifiable information.
Architecture of Imagen
Imagen uses a large frozen T5-XXL encoder to encode the input text into embeddings. A conditionaldiffusion modelmaps the text embedding into a 64×64 image. Imagen further utilizes text-conditional super-resolution diffusion models to upsample the image 64×64→256×256 and 256×256→1024×1024.
Evaluation of Imagen Models
DeepMind evaluates theImagen 3 model, which is the best quality configuration, against theImagen 2and the external models DALL·E 3, Midjourney v6, Stable Diffusion 3 Large, and Stable Diffusion XL 1.0. DeepMind found that Imagen 3 sets a new state of the art in text-to-image generation through rigorous evaluations by humans and machines.Qualitative ResultsandInference on Evaluationcontain qualitative results and a discussion of the overall findings and limitations. Product integrations with Imagen 3 may result in performance that is different from the configuration that was tested.

Human Evaluation: How Raters Judged Imagen 3’s Output Quality?
Thetext-to-image generation modelis evaluated on five quality aspects: overall preference, prompt-image alignment, visual appeal, detailed prompt-image alignment, and numerical reasoning. These aspects are independently assessed to avoid conflation in raters’ judgments. Side-by-side comparisons are used for quantitative judgment, while numerical reasoning can be evaluated directly by counting how many objects of a given type are depicted in an image.
The complete Elo scoreboard is generated through an exhaustive comparison of every pair of models. Each study consists of 2500 ratings uniformly distributed among the prompts in the prompt set. The models are anonymized in the rater interface, and the sides are randomly shuffled for every rating. Data collection is conducted using Google DeepMind’s best practices on data enrichment, ensuring all data enrichment workers are paid at least a local living wage. The study collected 366,569 ratings in 5943 submissions from 3225 different raters. Each rater participated in at most 10% of the studies and provided approximately 2% of the ratings to avoid biased results to a particular set of raters’ judgments. Raters from 71 different nationalities participated in the studies.
Overall User Preference: Imagen 3 Takes the Lead in Creative Image Generation
The overall preference of users regarding the generated image given a prompt is an open question, with raters deciding which quality aspects are most important. Two images were presented to raters, and if both were equally appealing, “I am indifferent.”
Results showed that Imagen 3 was significantly more preferred on GenAI-Bench, DrawBench, and DALL·E 3 Eval. Imagen 3 led with a smaller margin on DrawBench thanStable Diffusion 3, and it had a slight edge on DALL·E 3 Eval.
Prompt-Image Alignment: Capturing User Intent with Precision
The study evaluates the representation of an input prompt in an output image content, ignoring potential flaws or aesthetic appeal. Raters were asked to choose an image that better captures the prompt’s intent, disregarding different styles. Results showed Imagen 3 outperforms GenAI-Bench, DrawBench, and DALL·E 3 Eval, with overlapping confidence intervals. The study suggests that ignoring potential defects or bad quality in images can improve the accuracy of prompt-image alignment.
Visual Appeal: Aesthetic Excellence Across Platforms
Visual appeal measures the appeal of generated images, regardless of content. Raters rate two images side by side without prompts. Midjourney v6 leads, with Imagen 3 almost on par on GenAI-Bench, slightly bigger on DrawBench, and a significant advantage on DALL·E 3 Eval.
Detailed Prompt-Image Alignment
The study evaluates prompt-image alignment capabilities by generating images from detailed prompts of DOCCI, which are significantly longer than previous prompt sets. The researchers found reading 100+ word prompts too challenging for human raters. Instead, they used high-quality captions of real reference photographs to compare the generated images with benchmark reference images. The raters focused on the semantics of the images, ignoring styles, capturing technique, and quality. The results showed that Imagen 3 had a significant gap of +114 Elo points and a 63% win rate against the second-best model, highlighting its outstanding capabilities in following the detailed contents of input prompts.
Numerical Reasoning: Outperforming the Competition in Object Count Accuracy
The study evaluates the ability of models to generate an exact number of objects using the GeckoNum benchmark task. The task involves comparing the number of objects in an image to the expected quantity requested in the prompt. The models consider attributes like color and spatial relationships. The results show that Imagen 3 is the strongest model, outperforming DALL·E 3 by 12 percentage points. It also has higher accuracy when generating images containing 2-5 objects and better performance on more complex sentence structures.
Automated Evaluation: Comparing Models with CLIP, Gecko, and VQAScore
In recent years, automatic-evaluation (auto-eval) metrics like CLIP and VQAScore have become more widely used to measure the quality of text-to-image models. This study focuses on auto-eval metrics for prompt image alignment and image quality to complement human evaluations.
Prompt–Image Alignment
The researchers choose three strong auto-eval prompt-image alignment metrics: Contrastive dual encoders (CLIP), VQA-based (Gecko), and an LVLM prompt-based (an implementation of VQAScore2). The results show that CLIP often fails to predict the correct model ordering, while Gecko and VQAScore perform well and agree about 72% of the time. VQAScore has the edge as it matches human ratings 80% of the time, compared to Gecko’s 73.3%. Gecko uses a weaker backbone, PALI, which may account for the difference in performance.
The study evaluates four datasets to investigate model differences under diverse conditions: Gecko-Rel, DOCCI-Test-Pivots, Dall·E 3 Eval, and GenAI-Bench. Results show that Imagen 3 consistently has the highest alignment performance. SDXL 1 and Imagen 2 are consistently less performant than other models.
Image Quality
Regarding image quality, the researchers compare the distribution of generated images by Imagen 3, SDXL 1, andDALL·E 3 on 30,000 samples of the MSCOCO-caption validation set using different feature spaces and distance metrics. They observe that minimizing these three metrics is a trade-off, favoring the generation of natural colors and textures but failing to detect distortions on object shapes and parts. Imagen 3 presents the lower CMMD value of the three models, highlighting its strong performance on state-of-the-art feature space metrics.
Qualitative Results: Highlighting Imagen 3’s Attention to Detail
The image below shows 2 images upsampled to 12 megapixels, with crops showing the detail level.
Inference on Evaluation
Imagen 3 is the top model in prompt-image alignment, particularly in detailed prompts and counting abilities. In terms of visual appeal,Midjourneyv6 takes the lead, with Imagen 3 coming in second. However, it still has shortcomings in certain capabilities, such as numerical reasoning, scale reasoning, compositional phrases, actions, spatial reasoning, and complex language. These models struggle with tasks that require numerical reasoning, scale reasoning, compositional phrases, and actions. Overall, Imagen 3 is the best choice for high-quality outputs that respect user intent.
