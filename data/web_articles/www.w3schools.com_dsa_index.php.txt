Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.
Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.
Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.
This Tutorial
This tutorial is made to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  fast and easy.
Animations, like the one below, are used to explain ideas along the way.
{{ resultText }}: {{ currVal }}
First, you will learn the fundamentals of DSA: understanding different data structures, basic algorithm concepts, and how they are used in programming.
Then, you will learn more about complex data structures like trees and graphs, study advanced sorting and searching algorithms, explore concepts like time complexity, and more.
This tutorial will give you a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, an essential skill for any software developer.

In every chapter, you can edit the examples online, and click on a button to view the result.
The code examples in this tutorial are written in Python, C, and Java. You can see this by clicking the "Run Example" button.
Example
my_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]
minVal = my_array[0]

for i in my_array:
    if i < minVal:
        minVal = i

print('Lowest value:',minVal)
my_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]
minVal = my_array[0]

for i in my_array:
    if i < minVal:
        minVal = i

print('Lowest value:',minVal)
What You Should Already Know
Although Data Structures and Algorithms is actually not specific to any programming language, you should have a basic understanding of programming in one of these common programming languages:
Python
C
C++
Java
JavaScript
DSA History
The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.
The concept of algorithmic problem-solving can be traced back to ancient times, long before the invention of computers.
The study of Data Structures and Algorithms really took off with the invention of computers in the 1940s, to efficiently manage and process data.
Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.
