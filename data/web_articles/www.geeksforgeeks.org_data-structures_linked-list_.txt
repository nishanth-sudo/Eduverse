Linked List Data Structure
Alinked listis a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficientinsertionanddeletionoperations compared toarrays.  Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. Here’s the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays
Linked List:
Data Structure:Non-contiguous
Memory Allocation:Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
Insertion/Deletion:Efficient
Access:Sequential
Array:
Data Structure:Contiguous
Memory Allocation:Typically allocated to the whole array
Insertion/Deletion:Inefficient
Access:Random
