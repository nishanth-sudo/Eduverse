Frequently Asked Questions about Angular
ThisAngular tutorialstarts with the architecture of Angular, setting up a simple project, and data binding, then walks through forms and templates and explains Angular's new features. This tutorial is designed for beginners and experienced developers who want to learn Angular from scratch or enhance their skills.
What is Angular?
Angularis an open source,TypeScriptbased front end web application framework. It has been released byGoogle's Angularcommunity.
Angular provides a large collection of tools, APIs, and libraries to build dynamic and interactive single-page applications (SPAs) with ease. It helps maintain an organized and scalable codebase, thanks to its component model and flexible dependency injection system.
Angular Example
In this example, we will write aHello World!program in Angular. For this, create an Angular application and navigate tosrcfolder. Inside this folder, you will find theapp.component.htmlandapp.component.tsfiles. Copy and paste the following code inside those files:
app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterOutlet],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.css'
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello World App';
}
app.component.html
<h3>{{title}}</h3>
<p>Hello World!</p>
On running this application, you will get the following result −

Frequently Asked Questions about Angular
In this section, we will provide brief answers to some of the Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ) about Angular.
TypeScript is known as a superset of JavaScript. As the name suggests, it adds types on top of JavaScript syntax.
The most significant difference between AngularJS and Angular is that AngularJS uses JavaScript while Angular uses TypeScript. And, the AngularJS uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, but, Angular replaces it with Components.
Those web applications that load only one web page and update its content dynamically without reloading are called Single Page Application.
In Angular,decoratorsare methods more specifically design patterns that are prefixed with @symbol. They provides configuration metadata that specifies how a component, class, or method should be processed and used at runtime. Types of decorators are −
Property Decorators
Class Decorators
Parameter Decorators
Method Decorators
In Angular, templates are a form of HTML. They are used to instruct Angular how to produces views or user-interface.
Directives in Angular are classes that are used to add new behaviour to the elements. Types of Angular directives are −
Component Directives
Structural Directives
Attribute Directives
The Angular components are the fundamental building blocks of an Angular application. They control the views and behaviour of the application as they contain an HTML template, Selector and TypeScript class.
Services in Angular are used to share data, functions with different components of an Angular application.
