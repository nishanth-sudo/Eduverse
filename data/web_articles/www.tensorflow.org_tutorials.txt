TensorFlow Core
TensorFlowLearnTensorFlow CoreStay organized with collectionsSave and categorize content based on your preferences.The TensorFlow tutorials are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab—a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup. At the top of each tutorial, you'll see aRun in Google Colabbutton. Click the button to open the notebook and run the code yourself.For beginnersThe best place to start is with the user-friendly Keras sequential API. Build models by plugging together building blocks. After these tutorials, read theKeras guide.Beginner quickstartThis "Hello, World!" notebook shows the Keras Sequential API andmodel.fit.Keras basicsThis notebook collection demonstrates basic machine learning tasks using Keras.Load dataThese tutorials usetf.datato load various data formats and build input pipelines.For expertsThe Keras functional and subclassing APIs provide a define-by-run interface for customization and advanced research. Build your model, then write the forward and backward pass. Create custom layers, activations, and training loops.Advanced quickstartThis "Hello, World!" notebook uses the Keras subclassing API and a custom training loop.CustomizationThis notebook collection shows how to build custom layers and training loops in TensorFlow.Distributed trainingDistribute your model training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs.The Advanced section has many instructive notebooks examples, includingNeural machine translation,Transformers, andCycleGAN.Video tutorialsCheck out these videos for an introduction to machine learning with TensorFlow:TensorFlow ML Zero to HeroBasic Computer Vision with MLLibraries and extensionsExplorelibrariesto build advanced models or methods using TensorFlow, and access domain-specific application packages that extend TensorFlow.
