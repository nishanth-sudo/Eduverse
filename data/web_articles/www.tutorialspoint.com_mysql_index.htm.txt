MySQL Tutorial
MySQL is the most popular and a free Open Source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). An RDBMS system stores the data in the form of tables that might be related to each other. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to store, manage and retrieve data, and control the accessibility to the data. It is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing web-based software applications.
MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.
This tutorial will give you quick start with MySQL and make you comfortable with MySQL programming.
MySQL Examples
Consider an example table CUSTOMERS created in the MySQL database. This table contains the details of customers like ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY.
ID
NAME
AGE
ADDRESS
SALARY
1
Ramesh
32
Ahmedabad
2000.00
2
Khilan
25
Delhi
1500.00
3
Kaushik
23
Kota
2000.00
4
Chaitali
25
Mumbai
6500.00
5
Hardik
27
Bhopal
8500.00
6
Komal
22
Hyderabad
4500.00
7
Muffy
24
Indore
10000.00
Since MySQL uses SQL to manage data, it also uses almost all DDL, DML and DCL statements. For instance, the following DML statement lists the records of all customers who are 25 years old.
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25;
Following records are displayed as a result-set −
ID
NAME
AGE
ADDRESS
SALARY
2
Khilan
25
Delhi
1500.00
4
Chaitali
25
Mumbai
6500.00
MySQL Online Editor
In this tutorial, we provide a MySQL Online Editor which helps you to Edit and Execute the MySQL code directly from your browser. Click on theicon to run the following MySQL code to be executed on the CUSTOMERS table and retrieve the records matching with the given condition.
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME = 'Chaitali';
This Online Editor will save you the time to install the MySQL setup in order to execute any query. Try ourMySQL Online Editornow.

Who Should Learn MySQL
This MySQL tutorial has been prepared for beginners to help them understand the basics to advanced concepts related to MySQL database.
Prerequisites to Learn MySQL
Before you start doing practice with various types of examples given in this reference, I'm making an assumption that you are already aware about what is database, especially RDBMS and what is a computer programming language.
Frequently Asked Questions about MySQL
Following are very Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ) about MySQL, and this section tries to answer them briefly.
MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It organizes data into tables with rows and columns. Users can interact with MySQL using SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform operations like inserting, updating, and querying data. The system works by processing SQL commands to manage and retrieve data efficiently.
MySQL was developed by Swedish company MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael "Monty" Widenius. It was later bought by Sun Microsystems in 2008, which was subsequently acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.
You can install MySQL from the MySQL Installer Community, along with other MySQL products you require. The MySQL Installer will allow you to install a certain version of MySQL or you can customize the installation as per your requirements. For more detailed information on how to install MySQL,click here.
Since MySQL uses SQL to store and manage the data, the data types used in MySQL are also the same as data types in SQL. Following are three categories of SQL data types.
String Data types.
Numeric Data types.
Date and time Data types.
Here are the summarized list of tips which you can follow to start learning MySQL.
Install MySQL database on your computer system.
Follow our tutorial step by step from the very beginning.
Read more articles, watch online courses or buy a book on MySQL to enhance your knowledge.
Try to develop a small software using PHP or Python which makes use of the MySQL database.
The time it takes to learn MySQL varies, but basic proficiency can be gained in a few weeks with consistent practice. Mastering more advanced features may take a few months of dedicated learning and hands-on experience. Regular practice and real-world application contribute to the speed of learning MySQL.
The latest version of MySQL was 8.0. Upgrading to the latest version is recommended for security and feature enhancements.
To check the MySQL version in Linux, you can use the following command in the terminal:
mysql --version
This command will display the MySQL client version. If you want to check the server version, you can use:
mysql -u your_username -p -e "SELECT version();"
Replace "your_username" with your MySQL username, and you will be prompted to enter your password. After entering the password, the command will display the MySQL server version.
To access your MySQL database, you can use the MySQL command-line client or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool. Here are the basic steps for both:
Using MySQL Command-Line Client
Open terminal/command prompt.
Enter: mysql -u your_username -p.
Enter your password when prompted.
Using GUI Tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench)
Download and install the tool.
Create a new connection with your details.
Test the connection.
Use the GUI to manage your MySQL database.
MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its ease of use and scalability. Its main features include support for SQL queries, efficient data storage and retrieval, and robust transaction management, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small websites to large enterprise systems. Additionally, MySQL offers strong security measures and a vibrant community for support and development.
To start, stop, or restart the MySQL server, you can use the command-line interface. The exact commands may vary depending on your operating system. Here are instructions for different operating systems:
Windows:
To Start MySQL Server: Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run the following command:net start mysql.
To Stop MySQL Server: Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run the following command:net stop mysql.
To Restart MySQL Server: You can stop and start the MySQL service using the commands mentioned above. Alternatively, you can use the MySQL Notifier or the Services application to restart the MySQL service.
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
To Start MySQL Server:sudo service mysql start.
To Stop MySQL Server:sudo service mysql stop.
To Restart MySQL Server:sudo service mysql restart.
macOS:
To Start MySQL Server:sudo brew services start mysql.
To Stop MySQL Server:sudo brew services stop mysql.
To Restart MySQL Server:sudo brew services restart mysql.
These are general commands, and depending on your specific setup, you might need to adjust them. Also, note that on Linux, the service management commands may vary depending on the distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
Remember to replace "mysql" with the actual service name if it's different in your system.
A MySQL schema can simply be defined as a blueprint of the database. It stores all the information of the tables, its attributes and entities. As MySQL is a relational database management system, it is important to have schema as it also represents the relationship between the attributes and entities of multiple tables.
