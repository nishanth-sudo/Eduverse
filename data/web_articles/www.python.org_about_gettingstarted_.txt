Getting Started
Python For BeginnersWelcome! Are youcompletely new to programming?
Ifnotthen we presume you will be looking for information about
why and how to get started with Python.
Fortunately an
experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be)
can pick up Python very quickly.
It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, sojump in!InstallingInstalling Python is generally easy, and nowadays
many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python.
Even
some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python
already installed.
If youdoneed to install Python and aren't confident about the
task you can find
a few notes on theBeginnersGuide/Downloadwiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.LearningBefore getting started, you may want to find out whichIDEsandtext
editorsare tailored to make
Python editing easy, browse the list ofintroductory books, or look atcode samplesthat you might find
helpful.There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on theBeginnersGuide/Tutorialspage. There is also a list ofresources in other languageswhich might be useful if English is not your first language.Theonline documentationis your first port of call for definitive information.
There is a fairly brieftutorialthat gives you basic information about the language and
gets you started. You can follow this by looking at thelibrary referencefor a full description of Python's many libraries and thelanguage referencefor
a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax.
If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you
can browse theActiveState Python CookbookLooking for Something Specific?If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library
with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a
number of possible sources of information. The Python web site
provides aPython Package Index(also known as theCheese Shop, a reference to the Monty Python
script of that name).
There is also asearch pagefor a number of sources of Python-related
information. Failing that, justGooglefor a phrase including the word ''python''
and you may well get the result you need.
If all else fails, ask on thepython newsgroupand there's a good chance someone will put you on the right track.Frequently Asked QuestionsIf you have a question, it's a good idea to try theFAQ, which answers the most commonly
asked questions about Python.Looking to Help?If you want to help to develop Python, take a look at thedeveloper areafor further information.
Please note that you don't have to be an expert programmer
to help.  The documentation is just as important as the
compiler, and still needs plenty of work!
