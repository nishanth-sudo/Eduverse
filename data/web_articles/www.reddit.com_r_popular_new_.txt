Anyone else get really dirty lashes daily (no extensions, no make-up)?r/beautyr/beautyA place for beauty-related discussions, questions, and advice.MembersOnline•Anyone else get really dirty lashes daily (no extensions, no make-up)?Hi guys!Bit of an odd one, but I noticed that my lashes just tend to be quite dirty and have small clumps at the roots (not sure if it is lash serum, sleep, make-up or just a bit of everything). I dont wear extensions or eye make-up (I do wear mineral powder daily). I wash my face twice a day and pour water over my lashes as well and then I just put eyelash serum on the lashes.I have very frail and not that many eyelashes (they do get long, but then fall off quite quickly), so I dont like touching them at all. But I was just wondering if anyone had this issue as well or if it is just good practise to clean your lashes even without using make-up on them? I never had this issue in the past, strangely.
