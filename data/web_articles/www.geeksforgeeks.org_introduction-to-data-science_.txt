Data Science Introduction
Every time we browse the internet, shop online, or use social media, we generate data. But dealing with this enormous amount of raw data is not easy. It is like  trying to navigate a huge library where all the books are scattered randomly. Data science is about making sense of the vast amounts of data generated around us. Data science helps business uncovering patterns, trends, and insights hidden within numbers, text, images, and more. It combines the power of mathematics, programming, and domain expertise to answer questions, solve problems, and even make prediction about the future trend or requirements.
For example, from the huge raw data of a company, data science can help answer following question:
What do customer want?
How can we improve our services?
What will the upcoming trend in sales?
How much stock they need for upcoming festival.
In short, data science empowers the industries to make smarter, faster, and more informed decisions. In order to find patterns and achieve such insights, expertise in relevant domain is required. With expertise in Healthcare, a data scientists can predict patient risks and suggest personalized treatments.
Where data science is being used?
Data Science is being used in almost all major industry. Here are some examples:
Predicting customer preferences for personalized recommendations.
Detecting fraud in financial transactions.
Forecasting sales and market trends.
Enhancing healthcare with predictive diagnostics and personalized treatments.
Identifying risks and opportunities in investments.
Optimizing supply chains and inventory management.
And the list can keep going..
Data Science Skills
All these data science actions are performed by a Data Scientists. Let’s see essential skills required for data scientists
Programming Languages:Python, R, SQL.
Mathematics:Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability.
Machine Learning:Supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning basics.
Data Manipulation:Pandas, NumPy, data wrangling techniques.
Data Visualization:Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI.
Big Data Tools:Hadoop, Spark, Hive.
Databases:SQL, NoSQL, data querying and management.
Cloud Computing:AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
Version Control:Git, GitHub, GitLab.
Domain Knowledge:Industry-specific expertise for problem-solving.
Soft Skills:Communication, teamwork, and critical thinking.
Without any hunches, let’s dive into the world of Data Science. After touching to slightest idea, you might have ended up with many questions like What is Data Science? Why do we need it?How can I be a Data Scientist??etc? So let’s clear ourselves from this baffle.
Data Science Life Cycle
Data science is not a one-step process such that you will get to learn it in a short time and call ourselves a Data Scientist. It’s passes from many stages and every element is important. One should always follow the proper steps to reach the ladder. Every step has its value and it counts in your model.
1. Problem Statement:
No work start without motivation, Data science is no exception though. It’s really important to declare or formulate your problem statement very clearly and precisely. Your whole model and it’s working depend on your statement. Many scientist considers this as the main and much important step of Date Science. So make sure what’s your problem statement and how well can it add value to business or any other organization.
2. Data Collection:
After defining the problem statement, the next obvious step is to go in search of data that you might require for your model. You must do good research, find all that you need. Data can be in any form i.e unstructured or structured. It might be in various forms like videos, spreadsheets, coded forms, etc. You must collect all these kinds of sources.
3. Data Cleaning:
As you have formulated your motive and also you did collect your data, the next step to do is cleaning. Yes, it is! Data cleaning is the most favorite thing for data scientists to do. Data cleaning is all about the removal of missing, redundant, unnecessary and duplicate data from your collection. There are various tools to do so with the help of programming in either R orPython. It’s totally on you to choose one of them. Various scientist have their opinion on which to choose. When it comes to the statistical part, R is preferred over Python, as it has the privilege of more than 12,000 packages. While python is used as it is fast, easily accessible and we can perform the same things as we can in R with the help of various packages.
4. Data Analysis and Exploration:
It’s one of the prime things in data science to do and time to get inner Holmes out. It’s about analyzing the structure of data, finding hidden patterns in them, studying behaviors, visualizing the effects of one variable over others and then concluding. We can explore the data with the help of various graphs formed with the help of libraries using any programming language. In R, GGplot is one of the most famous models while Matplotlib in Python.
5. Data Modelling:
Once you are done with your study that you have formed from data visualization, you must start building a hypothesis model such that it may yield you a good prediction in future. Here, you must choose a good algorithm that best fit to your model. There different kinds of algorithms from regression to classification, SVM( Support vector machines), Clustering, etc. Your model can be of aMachine Learningalgorithm. You train your model with the train data and then test it with test data. There are various methods to do so. One of them is the K-fold method where you split your whole data into two parts, One is Train and the other is test data. On these bases, you train your model.
6. Optimization and Deployment:
You followed each and every step and hence build a model that you feel is the best fit. But how can you decide how well your model is performing? This where optimization comes. You test your data and find how well it is performing by checking its accuracy. In short, you check the efficiency of the data model and thus try to optimize it for better accurate prediction. Deployment deals with the launch of your model and let the people outside there to benefit from that. You can also obtain feedback from organizations and people to know their need and then to work more on your model.
Data Science Tools and Library
There are various tools required to analyze data, build models, and derive insights. Here are some of the most important tools in data science:
Jupyter Notebook:Interactive environment for coding and documentation.
Google Colab:Cloud-based Jupyter Notebook for collaborative coding.
TensorFlow:Deep learning framework for building neural networks.
PyTorch:Popular library for machine learning and deep learning.
Scikit-learn:Tools for predictive data analysis and machine learning.
Docker:Containerization for reproducible environments.
Kubernetes:Managing and scaling containerized applications.
Apache Kafka:Real-time data streaming and processing.
Tableau:A powerful tool for creating interactive and shareable data visualizations.
Power BI:A business intelligence tool for visualizing data and generating insights.
Keras:A user-friendly library for designing and training deep learning models.
Career Opportunities in Data Science
These are some major career options in data science field:
Data Scientist:Analyze and interpret complex data to drive business decisions.
Data Analyst:Focus on analyzing and visualizing data to identify patterns and insights.
Machine Learning Engineer:Develop and deploy machine learning models for automation and predictions.

How does Computer Vision Work?
Computer Vision Works similarly to our brain and eye work, To get any Information first our eye capture that image and then sends that signal to our brain. Then After, our brain processes that signal data and converted it into meaningful full information about the object then It recognizes/categorises that object based on its properties.
In a similar fashion to Computer Vision Work, In CV we have a camera to capture the Objects and Then it processes that Visual data by some pattern recognition algorithms and based on that property that object is identified. But, Before giving unknown data to the machine/Algorithm, we trained that machine on a vast amount of Visual labelled data. This labelled data enables the machine to analyze different patterns in all the data points and can relate to those labels.
Example: Suppose we provide audio data of thousands of bird songs. In that case, the computer learns from this data, analyzes each sound, pitch, duration of each note, rhythm, etc., and hence identifies patterns similar to bird songs and generates a model. As a result, this audio recognition model can now accurately detect whether the sound contains a bird song or not for each input sound.
