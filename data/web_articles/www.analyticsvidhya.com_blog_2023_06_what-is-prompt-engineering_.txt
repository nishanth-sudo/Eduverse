Conclusion
What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is a practice innatural language processingfield ofartificial intelligencewhere text describes what the AI demands to do. Guided by this input, the AI generates an output. This could be in different forms with the intent to use human-understandable text conversationally to communicate with models. Since the task description is embedded in the input, the model performs more flexibly with possibilities.

What are Prompts?
Prompts are a detailed description of desired output expected from the model. It is the interaction between a user and the AI model. This should give us more understanding of what engineering is about.
Examples of Prompt Engineering
The prompts used in large language models such asChatGPTandGPT-3could be simple text queries. With all this, the quality is measured by how much detail you can provide. These could be fortext summarization, question, and answer, code generation, information extraction, etc.
Since LLMs could be used to solve complex problems where many instructions are included, it is vital to be detailed. Let’s see some examples of basic prompts:
Prompt
Antibiotics are a type of medication used to treat bacterial infections. They work by either killing the bacteria or preventing them from reproducing, allowing the body's immune system to fight off the infection. Antibiotics are usually taken orally in the form of pills, capsules, or liquid solutions, or sometimes administered intravenously. They are not effective against viral infections, and using them inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance.
Summarize the above into 2 sentences:

We just saw an illustration of using LLMs. The possibility only goes endless. Types of Prompt engineering basics can be tailored for various outputs. Here are examples for different content types:
Text – ChatGPT, GPT
What’s the difference between generative AI and traditional AI?

Generate 300 words for each section of the article.
Create engaging headlines for each section.

Generate a first-person image looking out at orange clouds during a sunrise
How to Engineer your AI Prompts?
The quality of the prompt is critical. There are ways to improve them and get your models to improve outputs. Let’s see some tips below:
Role Playing:The idea is to make the model act as a specified system. Thus creating a tailored interaction and targeting a specific result. This saves time and complexity yet achieves tremendous results. This could be to act as a teacher, code editor, or interviewer.
Clearness:This means the removal of ambiguity. Sometimes, in the cause of trying to be detailed, we end up including unnecessary content. An excellent way to achieve this is to be brief.
Specification:This is related to role-playing, but the idea is to be specific and channeled to a streamlined direction. This avoids a scattered output.
Consistency:Consistency means maintaining flow in the conversation. Keep a uniform tone so that you can ensure legibility from the conversation.
Elements of a Prompt
These are the attributes that make up the skeleton of prompts. These can be:
Instruction:It is a statement tasking the model to perform something.
Context:Context is what streamlines the model to the problem. If not, it can go completely out of context and give poor responses.
Input Data:It is the input as a whole single entity.
Output Indicator:In role-playing, it indicates the type of output which will be a code. This element helps the model channel outputs suitably.
Standard Prompts Pattern
Let us try to see an overview of what a format looks like. Below is an example between a user and the model with straightforward instructions.
User: <Instruction>
Model: <Response>
User: <Instruction>
Model: <Response>
Few-Shot:It is a pattern for prompts using in-context learning. Here there is provision for in-context education, allowing the model to process examples beforehand. We will look at this more in the next section below. Few-shot can be formatted as follows:
<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
<Response>

<Instruction>
In a question-and-answer pattern, we have:

Prompting Techniques
There are different techniques used in writing prompts. They are the backbone.
1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Zero-shot provides a prompt that is not part of the training yet still performing as desired. In a nutshell, LLMs can generalize.
Example:
Prompt:
Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive.
Text: I think the presentation was awesome.
Sentiment:
Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive.
Text: I think the presentation was awesome.
Sentiment:
Output:
Positive
Positive
The knowledge of the meaning of “sentiment” made the model zero-shot how to classify the question even though it has not been given a bunch of text classifications to work on. There might be a pitfall since no descriptive data is provided in the text. Then we can use few-shot prompting.
2. Few-Shot Prompting/In-Context Learning
In an elementary understanding, the few-shot uses a few examples (shots) of what it must do. This takes some insight from a demonstration to perform. Instead of relying solely on what it is trained on, it builds on the shots available.
3. Chain-of-thought (CoT)
CoT allows the model to achieve complex reasoning through middle reasoning steps. It involves creating and improving intermediate steps called “chains of reasoning” to foster better language understanding and outputs. It can be like a hybrid that combines few-shot on more complex tasks.
What to Avoid When Creating Prompts?
Before rounding up, they are somethings we should avoidwhen creating prompts:
Information Overload (Ambiguity): Try as much as possible to provide brief information since it could become junk and reduce the accuracy of the results.
Open-Ended Questions: It is recommended that we avoid asking inexact or open-ended questions. A vague question might be:Can you help me find my way home?They are non-specific and too generic and will cause imprecision and less resourceful responses.
Poor Use of Constraints: Constraints are boundaries and limitations to how scattered a situation can get. This requires providing specific requirements. This could be to role-play the model.
Conclusion
We have seen a detailed guide to prompt engineering basics providing insights into the fundamentals and how they function in AI models. AI has experienced a complete revolution regarding use cases with endless possibilities and futuristic applications. Prompts can guide AI models like human instructions, revolutionizing the future. Examples like ChatGPT. Understanding the principles and pillars is crucial for effective AI use.
