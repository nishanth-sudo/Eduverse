But, Before giving unknown data to the machine/Algorithm, we trained that machine on a vast amount of Visual labelled data. This labelled data enables the machine to analyze different patterns in all the data points and can relate to those labels.Example: Suppose we provide audio data of thousands of bird songs. In that case, the computer learns from this data, analyzes each sound, pitch, duration of each note, rhythm, etc., and hence identifies patterns similar to bird songs and generates a model.

In a similar fashion to Computer Vision Work, In CV we have a camera to capture the Objects and Then it processes that Visual data by some pattern recognition algorithms and based on that property that object is identified. But, Before giving unknown data to the machine/Algorithm, we trained that machine on a vast amount of Visual labelled data. This labelled data enables the machine to analyze different patterns in all the data points and can relate to those labels.
Example: Suppose we provide audio data of thousands of bird songs. In that case, the computer learns from this data, analyzes each sound, pitch, duration of each note, rhythm, etc., and hence identifies patterns similar to bird songs and generates a model. As a result, this audio recognition model can now accurately detect whether the sound contains a bird song or not for each input sound.
