Operating System Tutorial
An Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.
Responsible for managing and controlling all the activities and sharing of computer resources among different running applications.
A low-level Software that includes all the basic functions like processor management, memory management, file management, etc.
It mainly acts a government for your system that has different departments to manage different resources.
Examples are Linux, Unix, Windows 11, MS DOS, Android, macOS and iOS.
