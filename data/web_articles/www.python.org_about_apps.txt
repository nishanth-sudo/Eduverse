Applications for Python
Python is used in many application domains.  Here's
a sampling.
ThePython Package Indexlists
thousands of third party modules for Python.
Web and Internet Development
Python offers many choices forweb development:
Frameworks such asDjangoandPyramid.
Micro-frameworks such asFlaskandBottle.
Advanced content management systems such asPloneanddjango CMS.
Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:
HTML and XML
JSON
E-mail processing.
Support forFTP,IMAP, and
otherInternet protocols.
Easy-to-usesocket interface.
And the Package Index has yet more libraries:
Requests, a powerful
HTTP client library.
Beautiful Soup,
an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.
Feedparserfor parsing
RSS/Atom feeds.
Paramiko, implementing
the SSH2 protocol.
Twisted Python, a framework for
asynchronous network programming.
Scientific and Numeric
Python is widely used inscientific and numericcomputing:
SciPyis a collection of packages for mathematics,
science, and engineering.
Pandasis a data analysis and
modeling library.
IPythonis a powerful interactive shell that
features easy editing and recording of a work session, and
supports visualizations and parallel computing.
TheSoftware Carpentry Courseteaches
basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing
open-access teaching materials.
Education
Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory
level and in more advanced courses.
Books such asHow to Think Like a Computer Scientist,Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, andPractical Programming.
TheEducation Special Interest Groupis a good place to discuss teaching issues.
Desktop GUIs
TheTkGUI library
is included with most binary distributions of Python.
Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available
separately:
wxWidgets
Kivy, for writing multitouch applications.
Qt viapyqtorpyside
Platform-specific toolkits are also available:
GTK+
Microsoft Foundation Classes through thewin32 extensions
Software Development
Python is often used as a support language for software developers,
for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.
SConsfor build control.
BuildbotandApache Gumpfor automated continuous compilation and testing.
RounduporTracfor bug tracking and project management.
Business Applications
Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:
Odoois an all-in-one management software that offers
a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management
applications.
Trytonis a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.
