When a browser requests an ASP or ASP.NET file, the ASP engine reads the file, executes 
any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser.

ASP (aka Classic ASP) was introduced in 1998 
as Microsoft's first server side scripting language.
Classic ASP pages have the file extension.aspand are normally written in VBScript.
