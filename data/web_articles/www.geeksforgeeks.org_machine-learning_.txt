Machine Learning Tutorial
Machine learningis a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
It can be broadly categorized into four types:
Supervised Learning:Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
Note:Self-supervised learning is not one of the original three, but it has become a major category in deep learning and fields like NLP and computer vision.
Semi-Supervised Learning:The model generates its own labels from the data, so we don’t need human-annotated labels.
