Responsive Web Development
Specifies that web applications should be accessible on devices of various shapes and sizes, particularly crucial for mobile devices due to increasing traffic.
Methods for Achieving Responsiveness:
Breakpoints:Web applications adjust width and height based on device characteristics to enhance user interaction.
Flexible Images:Ensures images fit within device width, adapting using frameworks or raw CSS.
Flexible Grids:CSS grids align layouts responsively to accommodate different device sizes.
Media Queries:CSS tool defining responsive changes at specific points based on device characteristics. Query in CSS is also used to make web pages responsive. In that we describe what to change on specific point.
Frontend Security
Whenever we create any web page and there is a section for login or signup then there must be a security so that the password given by the user must be secured and can not be accessed by third party between the login session. so we must provide security to our web pages. same goes for the web pages where a payment statement or any other confidential data is transfered or stored.
These are the attacks that can make your web page more risky:
DoS (denial of service) attacks:This attack is common in all the other attacks. It can be difficult to deal with this attack as it is originate from thousand of systems in a single time and make your web page very slow.
