The Llama 4 Models: Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth
Meta’s Llama 4 herd: Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth, are a group of highly efficient, open-source & multi-modal models. In a time when companies like OpenAI, Google, and X.com are building increasingly large but closed models, Meta has chosen a different route: making powerful AI open and accessible.  In fact, Llama 4 Maverick crossed the 1400 benchmark on the LMarena, beating models like GPT 4o, DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and more! Equally notable is the 10 million token context length supported by these models, which is the longest of any open-weight LLM to date. Let’s look at each of these models in detail.
Llama 4 Scout: Small, Fast, and Smart
Scout is the most efficient model in the Llama 4 family. It is a fast and lightweight model, ideal for developers and researchers who don’t have access to large GPU clusters.

llama.meta.com: This is Meta’s official hub for Llama models. It includes model cards, papers, technical documentation, and access to the open weights for both Scout and Maverick. Developers can download the models and run them locally or in the cloud.
Hugging Face:  Hugging Face hosts the ready-to-use versions of Llama 4. You can test models directly in the browser using inference endpoints or deploy them via the Transformers library. Integration with common tools like Gradio and Streamlit is also supported.
Meta Apps: The Llama 4 models also power Meta’s AI assistant available in WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook. This allows users to experience the models in real-world conversations, directly within their everyday apps.
Web Page: You can directly access the latest Llama 4 models using the web interface.
Llama 4 Models: Let’s Try!
It’s super easy to try the latest Llama 4 models across any of Meta’s apps or the web interface. Although it isn’t specifically mentioned in any of those, regarding which model -out of Scout, Maverick, and Behemoth – is used in the background. As of now, Meta AI hasn’t provided a choice to choose the model that you wish to work with on its apps or interface. Nonetheless, I’ll test the Llama 4 model for three tasks: Creative Planning, Coding, and Image Generation.
Task 1: Creative Planning
Prompt:“Create a Social Media content strategy for a Shoe Brand – Soles to help them engage with the Gen z audience”
Output:
Observation
Llama 4 models are very fast! The model quickly maps put a detailed yet concise plan for the social media strategy.
In the web interface, you can’t currently upload any files or images.
Also, it doesn’t support web search or canvas features yet.
Task 2: Coding
Prompt:”Write a python program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning pentagon, following the laws of Physics, increasing its speed every time it bounces off an edge.”
Output:
Observation
The code it generated had errors.
The model quickly processes the requirement but yet is not great when it comes to accuracy.
Task 3: Image Generation
Prompt:“Create an image of a person working on a laptop with a document open in the laptop with the title “llama 4”, the image should be taken in a way the screen of the person is visible, the table on which the laptop is kept has a coffee mug and a plant”
Output:
Observation
It generated 4 images! Out of those, I found the above image to be the best.
You also get the option to “Edit” and “Animate” the images that you have generated.
Editing allows you to rework certain sections of an image while Animating allows you to create a gif of the image.
Training and Post-Training of Llama 4 Models
Meta used a structured two-step process: pre-training and post-training, incorporating new techniques for better performance, scalability, and efficiency. Let’s break down the whole process:
Pre-Training Phase
Pre-training is the foundation for a model’s knowledge and ability. Meta introduced several innovations in this stage:
Multimodal Data: Llama 4 models were trained on over 30 trillion tokens from diverse text, image, and video datasets. They’re natively multimodal, meaning they handle both language and vision from the start.
Mixture of Experts (MoE): Only a subset of the model’s total parameters is active during each inference. This selective routing allows massive models like Maverick (400B total parameters) and Behemoth (~2T) to be more efficient.
Early Fusion Architecture: Text and vision inputs are jointly trained using early fusion, integrating both into a shared model backbone.
MetaP Hyperparameter Tuning: This new technique lets Meta set per-layer learning rates and initialization scales that transfer well across model sizes and training configurations.
FP8 Precision: All models use FP8 for training, which increases computing efficiency without sacrificing model quality.
iRoPE Architecture: A new approach using interleaved attention layers without positional embeddings and inference-time temperature scaling, helping Scout generalize to extremely long inputs (up to 10M tokens).
Post-Training Phase
After training the base models, the team fine-tuned them using a carefully crafted sequence:
Lightweight Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Meta filtered out easy prompts using Llama models as judges and only used harder examples to fine-tune performance on complex reasoning tasks.
Online Reinforcement Learning (RL): They implemented continuous RL training using hard prompts, adaptive filtering, and curriculum design to maintain reasoning, coding, and conversational capabilities.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): After RL, they applied lightweight DPO to fine-tune specific corner cases and response quality, balancing helpfulness and safety.
Behemoth Codistillation: Behemoth acted as a teacher by generating outputs for training Scout and Maverick. Meta even introduced a novel loss function to dynamically balance soft and hard supervision targets.
Together, these steps created models that aren’t just large, they’re deeply optimized, safer, and more capable across a wide range of tasks.
