DevOps TutorialLast Updated :23 May, 2025CommentsImproveSuggest changesLike ArticleLikeReportDevOpsis a combination of two words:"Development"and"Operations."It’s a modern approach where software developers and software operations teams work together throughout the entire software life cycle, from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.The main idea of DevOps is to improve the software delivery process. We achieve this by software release automation, continuous monitoring/logging and testing. The goals of DevOps are:Faster and continuous software releases.Reduces manual errors through automation.Built-in Monitoring,detect failures or issues during delivery or in production.Automate testing throughout the software delivery process.Before DevOps, software delivery was slow and manual, often taking up to 10 days to move code from development to production. Separate teams handled coding, server setup, testing, and deployment, leading to delays and frequent errors due to lack of automation.With DevOps, the process is fast, automated, and collaborative. Using tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, teams can build, test, and deploy code continuously, enabling deployment in hours instead of days.1. Understanding DevOps FundamentalsIn this section, we will cover the basic DevOps fundamentals and terminologies that are essential for a DevOps engineer. These concepts will help you build a clear understanding of DevOps and its core practices.What is DevOps and it's working?Lifecycle of DevOpsAgile Vs DevOpsDifference between Cloud and DevOps Engineer2. Linux for DevOpsLinux is one of the most widely used operating systems for servers and cloud environment, offering a powerful command-line interface, scripting environment, and strong security features. It is essential for learning DevOps, as most servers run on Linux operating system. Also, key tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Ansible are built to work best in Linux environments.This section introduces the core Linux concepts, commands, and networking essentials every DevOps engineer should know.What is Linux Operating System?Linux Commands for DevOpsNetwork configuration and troubleshooting commands in LinuxSSH Server (sshd) Configuration and Security Options With ExamplesLearn Linux in Advance with our:Linux Tutorial3.
