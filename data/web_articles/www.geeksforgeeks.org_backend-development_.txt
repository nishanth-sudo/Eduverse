Backend DevelopmentLast Updated :29 Apr, 2025CommentsImproveSuggest changesLike ArticleLikeReportBackend Development involves the logic, database, and other operations that are built behind the scenes to run the web servers efficiently. Backend Development refers to the server-side development of the web application. It is the part of the application where the server and database reside and the logics is build to perform operations. It includes the main features and functionalities of the application on the server. Programming languages for the backend are mainly Node. JS (for JavaScript), Django (for Python), Spring (Java), etc.Backend Developer Roadmap 20251. Knowledge of Web ServerThe web server runs websites, it stores, processes, and delivers (response) web pages to the user’s request. When the user makes a request by the web server, it is accepted by an HTTP server which finds and sends back the content to the browser through HTTP. Some examples of web servers are Apache and NGINX which are open-source platforms used to deliver content as per requests made.2. Programming Languages and Their FrameworksChoose and Learn any of the Programming languages and its frameworks.JS+NodeJS– With JavaScript being the most demanding programming language, you can explore various new concepts and build a very amazing website. It is used to build interactive and dynamic websites. For JS, we have a runtime environment which is NodeJS, which allows you to run JavaScript on the server.  We also have a framework likeExpress.JSbuilt on on Node.JS.Python+Django– Python is the easiest of all programming languages and with Django, it plays a perfect combination to build a website. With less code, you can build better and more easy web applications. Python is most commonly used for developing websites and it performs quicker implementations. Django is the most secure and scalable framework one should work with.PHP+Laravel– PHP (HyperText Preprocessor) is a general-purpose scripting language well suited for web development. It is a fast, flexible, and pragmatic language which powers everything from blogs to the most popular websites. Laravel is an open-source framework used to build a wide range of web applications. It is purely a server-side framework that manages data and uses MVC (Model View Controller) to break an application’s back-end architecture into logical parts making it easier to build.3. Version Control System (Git)Version control systemhelps in maintaining and tracking changes in code changes to be used for future implementations. They are software tools that help in managing changes in source code over time.Gitwhich is free and open-source can be the best choice as a version control system because of its secure, flexible, and easy-to-edit features.Why Git?It is the most commonly used version control systemIt tracks changes made in files.Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.You can move to specific versions whenever you want to.4. Knowledge of Web SecurityVarious threats can attack a website which could result in its poor performance. Web security refers to the protective measures and protocols developers should follow to build an optimized and effective website. It includes scanning a website for vulnerabilities to defend against thefts or loss that occurs due to digital hackers.Types of Risks developers face could be malware, backlisting, buffer overflow, and sensitive data exposure. Various techniques can be followed to avoid such issues:Using HTTPS:HTTPS is a secured HTTP. When data is sent using HTTPS, it is protected via the Transport Layer Security protocol, which has three layers of protection:Encryption: Way of securing data along with a password or “key” which is used to decrypt the information.Data Integrity:When data integrity is secure, information stored in a database is complete, accurate, and reliable for a lifetime.Authentication: This method protects against attacks and builds user trust which response to business growth.Implementing secure backup and recovery:Data loss could be the major threat that could lead to security breaches. To avoid this, make sure to implement a backup process. This could be implemented in many ways:Protecting media and content from theft or destruction.Periodically testing the backups.Apply a two-person rule so that one person cannot access the content or media without the permission of another article.and various other methods include XSS Attacks, Software updates, and SQL Injection.5. APIs (Application Programming Interface)AnAPI (Application Programming Interface)is a set of functions that perform accessing data and interacting with external software components, microservices, and OS. In short, it delivers users’ responses to the system and sends responses back to the user. It is because of APIs (which act as a software intermediary) that two applications talk to each other. APIs are used by backend developers to create connections between services or applications to initiate communication to improve user experience. Express is a good choice for a server to create and expose APIs to have client-server communication. Some of the APIs you should know about are:RESTJSONSOAPGSONXML-RPCAES6. Containerization & TestingContainerizationis the process of packaging software code with all the necessary elements like frameworks, libraries, and other dependencies, to make services isolated from each other in a container. This process is done by the backend developers to run a container easily. Docker and Kubernetes are the most used containers.Dockeris an open-source containerization platform, that enables developers to package applications into containers. It is similar to a virtual machine but much more efficient. Its basic use of it is it allows the applications to run in different environments.Kubernetesoften abbreviated as “K8s”, automates deploying and managing cloud-native applications using public cloud platforms.7. DeploymentWhen the testing passes, developers move to the deployment where they can see the working of their application. It can also be referred to as a live environment. This process includes 5 steps: Planning, development, testing, deploying, and monitoring.Planning:When multiple developers are working on the same project, a deployment plan is a necessity. Using this step, you avoid conflicts between changes made making sure the deployment process is as smooth and easy. This could lead to the quicker and more efficient development of the application.Development:Once, the planning is done, actual development takes place. This is the step where you gather ideas and prioritization requirements. Then, the management of the complete application can be moved to testing.Testing:Testing is a crucial step to ensure there are no bugs before moving it to the production level. Testing is possible only when you deploy it to various environments to check whether it fits in or not. Check for the bugs and if any, make sure to remove them and then move to the deployment process.Deploying:Seeing your application working live, with no bugs, and in an optimized way gives satisfaction to the effort made. It means pushing changes or updates from one environment to another.Monitoring:Constant monitoring is required to check whether the website is working well or not. There might be a chance that issues may occur after deploying as well, so keep an eye out for the proper functioning, and the time for release should be planned so that minimum users would have viewed and changes can be made to see the optimized web application.8. Cloud ProvidersEverything is making its way to the cloud, be it software, applications, services, or products. Cloud computing. It is Web-based computing that permits businesses and individuals to consume computing resources such as virtual machines, databases, processing, services, storage, and events, and gives you a pay-as-you-go service. Cloud computing can be divided into three major categories, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).The most used Cloud Services are:Amazon Web Services (AWS)Microsoft AzureGoogle CloudAlibaba CloudIBM CloudBackend Development Frameworks/TechnologiesLaravel: Laravel is a PHP framework for web applications, created byTaylor Otwellin 2011. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.Node JS: Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.Django: Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. It provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc.Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications. It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their applications.Flask: Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It was developed by TJ Holowaychuk.
