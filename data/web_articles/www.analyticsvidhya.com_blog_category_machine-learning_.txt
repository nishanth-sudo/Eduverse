Types of Machine Learning
There are two types of machine learning :
Supervised Learning:
The model is trained with labeled data in supervised learning, which means that the input data is matched with the appropriate output. Learning a mapping from inputs to outputs using the labeled training data is the aim. By generalizing from the training data, the model generates predictions on fresh, unseen data. Examples include regression problems (like predicting housing prices) and classification tasks (like spam detection).
Algorithms
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
k-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forests.
Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, which means that the model must independently identify patterns or structures in the incoming data. Often, the objective is to minimize the dimensionality of the data for simpler analysis, or to group or cluster related data points.
Examples: clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), and dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis—PCA).
Algorithms:
K-means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
PCA
t-SNE

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):Classifying data points. It does this based on how close they are to their neighbors.
K-means Clustering:Partitioning data (unsupervised) into clusters. This is based on the similarity of features.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): It tackles the reduction of large datasets to a lower dimension. Here, it also retains most variability present in the data.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is machine learning?Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
What is overfitting in machine learning?Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to learning noise or irrelevant patterns from the training data.
What are the types of machine learning?There are three main types of machine learning: Supervised Learning, where models learn from labeled data; Unsupervised Learning, where models identify patterns in unlabeled data; and Reinforcement Learning, where models learn by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
What is underfitting in machine learning?Underfitting happens when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test data.
What is a training set and a test set?The training set is the portion of data used to train the model, while the test set is the portion of data used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.
