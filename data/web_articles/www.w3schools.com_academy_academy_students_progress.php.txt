Heatmap overview
The heat map gives you a fast, visual overview of class-wide progress. Each lesson is represented as a square, and the darker the color, the more students have completed it.
In seconds, you can spot which topics are well understood, and which may need to be revisited.
The heatmap can help you when comparing different classes, planning reviews, or discussing progress with other teachers.
Track learning with detailed progress
Stay ahead of every student's journey. The detailed progress view shows exactly how far each student has come, lesson by lesson so you can catch learning gaps early, offer timely support, and adjust your follow-ups.
Because everything is logged and always up to date, it's also easier to handle everyday tasks like preparing for parent-teacher meetings, documenting individual learning plans, or reporting to school leadership. Without jumping between systems.
Check exam results for your classes

Students stay on track with their own dashboard
Just like the teacher's dashboard shows what the students are doing, the students have their own dashboard where they can see study plans, activities, deadlines, and progress. The dashboard helps the students stay on track, and makes it easier for you to teach.
Stay updated,with 40+ tutorials
Keeping up with new technologies isn't always easy. New frameworks and languages appear all the time, and it can feel overwhelming on top of your work in the classroom.
