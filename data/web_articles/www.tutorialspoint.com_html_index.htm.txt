Basic HTML Structure
The basic structure of an HTML document contains the few mandatory tags, that must be used to create a webpage. This structure must be followed to create any type of HTML document.
Here is the basic structure of an HTML document −
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Webpage's Heading</h1>
   <p>Content (Your first paragraph).</p>
</body>
</html>
Elements of HTML Basic Structure
The following are the basic tags that define the basic HTML structure −
1. <!DOCTYPE html>
This element defines thedocument type as HTML. This element must be written before writing any HTML document.
2. <html>...</html>
The<html> tagis the parent tag for all HTML elements. Everything related to create an HTML document must be written inside the <html> tag. CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery must also be written inside this tag.
3. <head>...</head>
The<head> tagis a container tag for all those elements that are not directly displayed on the webpage but required for the page functionalities. It contains meta tags (which are used for SEO purposes), title tag, script tags, etc.
4. <title>...</title>
The<title> tagis used to define the title of the webpage that you can see in the browser's tab, bookmarks list, and search engine results. This tag is also very important for SEO purposes to help search engine to understand the content of the webpage.
5. <body>...<body>
The<body> tagis the container tag for all those elements, which represents the main content of a webpage that displays on the browser.
6. <h1>...</h1>
The <h1> tag is one of theheading tags. It is the most important heading tag, which defines the main title or headline of the webpage. Any text written inside <h1> and </h1> is a top-level heading of the content.
7. <p>...</p>
The<p> tagdefines aparagraph, anything written inside <p> and </p> displays as a paragraph on the webpage. Use multiple <p> tags to display text in different paragraphs.
Writing Hello World in HTML

Below is the HTML code to display Hello World on the webpage in a paragraph −
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Hello World Example by TutorialsPoint</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
</pre>
The above example will display "Hello, World!" on the browser inside top-level heading (h1).
Comments in HTML
Just like other programming languages, you can keep any text as acomment inside an HTML document. To create a comment in HTML, use <!-- and -->.
Any text written inside <!-- and --> considers as comment and it does not display on the website.
Example
Below is the example of HTML comment −
<!--<h1>Hello World Example</h1>-->

</body>
</html>
