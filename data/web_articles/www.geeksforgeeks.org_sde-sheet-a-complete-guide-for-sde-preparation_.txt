These are tricky questions that let you think logically.Try to solve the20 most popular puzzles asked in InterviewsProjectsThoroughly revise all the work you have done till now in your projects. The grilling about projects can sometimes be very deep. Also, choose your words before you speak. Mention only those topics where you think you are fine to be grilled upon.If you haven't made a project then take an idea fromGfG Projectsand start working on these.System DesignSystem Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. System Design for tech interviews is something that can’t be ignored especially for experienced people Almost every IT giant whether it be Facebook, Amazon, Google, or any other ask various questions based on System Design concepts such as scalability, load-balancing, caching, etc. in the interview.Please referSystem Design tutorialthat will help you to learn and master System Design concepts in the most efficient way from basics to advanced level.Bonus SDE SheetsYou can prepare for several types of interviews here. For instance, if you want to prepare for a Google interview, we have an SDE sheet specifically designed for that purpose.
