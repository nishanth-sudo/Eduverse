What is GPT-4.1?
GPT‑4.1 is OpenAI’s newest generation large language model, succeedingGPT‑4oandGPT‑4.5with major advancements in intelligence, reasoning, and efficiency. But here’s what makes GPT‑4.1 different: it’s not just one model, it’s a family of three, each designed for different needs:
Models in the GPT-4.1 Family:
GPT‑4.1:The most capable model for high-level cognitive tasks – ideal for software development, research, and agentic workflows.
GPT‑4.1 mini:A mid-sized model optimized for balance, that matches or exceeds GPT‑4o intelligence with 83% lower cost and nearly half the latency.
GPT‑4.1 nano:A lightweight model offering blazing-fast response time and solid performance in classification, text generation, and autocomplete use cases.
All three models support up to1 million tokens of context; enough to handle entire books, large codebases, or lengthy transcripts while maintaining coherence and accuracy.
Note:GPT‑4.1 is currently available via API only. It’s not yet integrated into the ChatGPT web interface (Plus or free), so users won’t be able to directly access the model.
Key Features of GPT‑4.1
Here are the key features of OpenAI’s GPT-4.1:
1 Million Token Context:Ideal for full codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning, or chat memory over long interactions.
Long-Context Comprehension:Improved attention and retrieval in vast inputs, avoiding “lost in the middle” errors.
Instruction Following:Best-in-class performance in structured tasks: XML, YAML, Markdown, negation, ranking, etc.
State-of-the-Art Coding:Top scorer on SWE-bench, Aider Polyglot, and real-world dev tasks like frontend apps and PR reviews.
Speed & Efficiency:GPT‑4.1 mini and nano deliver huge latency and cost reductions for scaled applications.
Multimodal Strength:Handles images, charts, video comprehension, and visual reasoning better than GPT‑4o.
GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4o
When compared with its ancestor GPT-4o; GPT‑4.1 improves on nearly every axis:

GPT 4.1 Performance in Hands-on Applications
Now let’s try out GPT-4.1 and see how well it performs in real-world applications. In this section, we’ll explore three core areas where GPT-4.1 can significantly enhance development and problem-solving efficiency:
Building a pygame
Creating an animation
Solving a DSA problem
Let’s begin!
Task 1: Building a Bouncing Ball Game
First, let’s see how well GPT-4.1 can create a game using Python and pygame.
Prompt Input:
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
   messages=[
       {"role": "user",
       "content": "You are a senior python programming developer and an expert in developing games with python and pygame"
       },
       {"role": "assistant",
       "content": """Create a simple bouncing ball game using Python and the Pygame library. The game should feature a ball that continuously moves and bounces off the window’s walls and a player-controlled paddle at the bottom, which prevents the ball from falling off the screen.
The paddle should be controlled using the left and right arrow keys, and the ball should reflect realistically upon collision with the paddle and walls.
Each successful bounce on the paddle should increment the player’s score, which is displayed in the top-left corner. If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends and a “Game Over” message should appear with the final score and an option to restart the game by pressing “R”.
Include basic sound effects for collisions and game over events. Structure the code using classes for the ball and paddle, and maintain a clear game loop for updates and rendering. """
       },
   ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
   messages=[
       {"role": "user",
       "content": "You are a senior python programming developer and an expert in developing games with python and pygame"
       },
       {"role": "assistant",
       "content": """Create a simple bouncing ball game using Python and the Pygame library. The game should feature a ball that continuously moves and bounces off the window’s walls and a player-controlled paddle at the bottom, which prevents the ball from falling off the screen.

       },
   ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
Output by GPT-4.1:
Analysis:
The bouncing ball game fulfills all functional requirements, featuring well-structured classes, collision detection, and restart functionality, made possible by GPT-4.1’s clear and organized code. However, the gameplay remains basic, with room for improvement in visuals and depth. Overall, GPT-4.1’s output is great for beginners in game development.
Task 2: Creating a Candle Animation
Now let’s try creating a front-end animation using the model.
Prompt Input:
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
   messages=[
       {
           "role": "user",
           "content": "You are a senior front-end developer and an expert in creating visually rich animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
       },
       {
           "role": "assistant",
       "content": """Create a candle animation. The candle should be centered on a dark background, with a simple wax body and a flame that subtly changes shape, size, and brightness to simulate natural flickering.
Use CSS animations to create random variations in the flame’s opacity, height, and color gradients (ranging from yellow to orange and red).
Small spark particles should occasionally rise from the flame, drifting upwards with gentle horizontal movement and gradually fading out. All elements—the candle, flame, and sparks—should be built using HTML and styled with CSS, with no external image assets.
Ensure smooth animation at a consistent frame rate using requestAnimationFrame or CSS keyframes."""},
   ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
   messages=[
       {
           "role": "user",
           "content": "You are a senior front-end developer and an expert in creating visually rich animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
       },
       {
           "role": "assistant",
       "content": """Create a candle animation. The candle should be centered on a dark background, with a simple wax body and a flame that subtly changes shape, size, and brightness to simulate natural flickering.

   ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
Output by GPT-4.1-nano:
Analysis:
The animation attempts the concept but falls short due to the noticeable gap between the flame and the candle, which disrupts the visual effect. While sparks and flickering are present, the overall execution feels incomplete. GPT-4.1-mini struggles to fully meet the design and layout expectations of the prompt.
Task 3: DSA Problem
For the final task, let’s see how efficient GPT-4.1 is in solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
Prompt Input:
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14",
   messages=[
       {
           "role": "user",
           "content": "You are a senior competitive programmer and data structures & algorithms expert specializing in solving graph-based problems using C++."
       },
       {
           "role": "assistant",
       "content": """A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.
The graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph.
The mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, the cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a hole at node 0.
During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1].
Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0).
Then, the game can end in three ways:

If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.
Given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return

1 if the mouse wins the game,
2 if the cat wins the game, or
0 if the game is a draw.

Input: graph = [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
Output: 0

Input: graph = [[1,3],[0],[3],[0,2]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
3 <= graph.length <= 50
1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length
0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length
graph[i][j] != i
graph[i] is unique.
The mouse and the cat can always move. """},
   ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
   model="gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14",

   ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
Output by GPT-4.1:
Although the model generated the code, I ran into some errors while trying to run it.
Errors in Generated Code:
Analysis:
The implementation attempts to model the game using optimal game theory with a reverse BFS approach but falls short due to critical compilation issues. It uses structured bindings and std::array without including necessary headers or ensuring compatibility with standard C++17, resulting in broken execution. While the algorithmic direction is valid, GPT-4.1-nano struggles to produce a compile-ready solution and fails to meet the practical coding standards expected for graph-based game problems.
