I have nothing against Reynolds and the other one, I've watched a few episodes of the Disney+ show, enjoyable if a bit boring after a while.
As a result I was happy for them to rise up through the leagues.
But, now in the Championship I have a burning desire to see them pumped every single week and sent back to their s-hole in Wales and hopefully League One.
Is it just me that suddenly wants to see them smash to bits by all of us?
