Computer Network Tutorial
A Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.These networks can range from simple setups, like connecting two devices in your home, to massive global systems, like the Internet. Below are the main components of a computer network.
Node: Any device which can share or receive data. Examples of devices are laptop, mobile, printer, earbuds and server.
Transmission Media :The medium through which devices communicate It can be a wired media like Optical Fiber and Ethernet Cables. It can also be a wireless media like WiFi, Bluetooth and Infrared.
Protocol: The set of rules that devices use to communicate. There are many different protocols for different types of communications. Examples are HTTP (For web browsing) and SMTP (For emails).
Networking Devices: The devices with main purpose of providing network facilities. Examples are Router, Switch, Access Point and Hub.
Networking Applications: Software that provide an interface to communicate and share. Examples are browser, email clients, and file sharing applications
Computer networks are an important part of our daily lives. They allow devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets to connect and communicate with each other. Whether you’re browsing the internet, sending an email, or streaming a video, it all happens because of computer networks.
