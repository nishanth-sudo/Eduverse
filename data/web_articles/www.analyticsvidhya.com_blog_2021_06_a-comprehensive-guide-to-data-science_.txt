Best Knowledge Portal for Data Science
AV is one of the best knowledge portal for Data Science I know about and certainly the best in India. It caters to the need of all sorts of people, from beginners to well experienced professionals. The articles are in-depth in nature and cover wide-variety as well which is very difficult to find else where. Discuss portals help people to clarify their doubts while hackathons give a flavor of real world experience. Thank you AV and keep up the good work.!

Excellent Opportunity for Anyone
Analytics Vidhya hackathons are an excellent opportunity for anyone who is keen on improving and testing their data science skills. The portal offers a wide variety of state of the art problems like – image classification, customer churn, prediction, optimization, click prediction, NLP and many more. I have participated in many hackathons and they have been a significant contributor in improving my machine learning skills. These hackathons have real time submission and evaluation feature and you can always feel the competition heat on the leader-board. Hackathons also provide an immense opportunity for learning from other’s, as winner’s approach and code is shared at the end of the hackathon. I won the Barcelona water demand prediction hackathon and it boosted my confidence and network significantly.
Aanish Singla
Director of Data Science
Learnt a Lot
I learnt a lot by participating in various Hackathons conducted by Analytics Vidhya during last three years. One obvious benefit is given a dataset I can intuitively understand what works best which I apply in real life problems efficiently. My strategy in any Hackathon is to understand the dataset, feature engineering and cross validation. I try ensembling, hyper parameter tuning or stacking only if I have time. I believe feature engineering and cross validation is more important than your choice of algorithms.

My Guide and Mentor
I started my journey in analytics in August 2014 through an online course. Then came AV which gave a newbie like me a platform when my first article was published.Thereafter the association with AV has grown to AV being my guide and mentor. There is no dearth of analytics resources on the web but when you get it from experts in the Indian analytics space with a clear business problem in mind-there is nothing like it.The easy to understand language used to explain the most complex of subjects in data science is one of the cornerstones of the AV blog.The one place I know I will find answers to my questions and gain knowledge is AV. In the language of Data Science AV is an ensemble of many experts which bring out what is best for the community. :)

Thinking out of box
Right from college, I liked to participate in competitions and Analytics Vidhya helped me compete amongst the finest people. Now, even as I'm working as a full time data scientist, I still like to give it my best during these short yet intense competitions as it helps me think out of the box and get the best out of myself. I usually start with looking at the data and checking the distribution of features and target variables which involves a lot of group by commands. Once I settle for an initial feature set, I train a basic model to see where I am in the leaderboard. From there on it can go to completely revamping the model to use some new methodologies or tuning the model and features.

Growth Through Skill-Building Blogathons
"I have been writing for Analytics Vidhya since April 2021 and that’s how my data science journey began. As I was learning data science on my own, it was essential to receive feedback. That is where Analytics Vidhya’s blogathon helped me. I would first read and research a topic, do projects from datasets available on Kaggle, and post which I would write articles on Analytics Vidhya through the Data Science Blogathons. Analytics Vidhya has a large data science community, which provided me with visibility and enabled me to receive a freelance offer! Your understanding would only improve when you receive feedback from fellow data scientists, and constructive feedback from their editorial team. Data Science Blogathon happens every month, and you receive a guaranteed stipend if your article is published. And if you are consistent and lucky, you might also win an Ipad like me:) Yes, you read it right! I am delighted to share that I have received an Ipad, 9th Gen from Analytics Vidhya in Blogathon 18 lucky draw. Hence, I would encourage students who plan to build a career in Data Science could leverage this exciting opportunity."

Forging Community and Skills
Since embarking on my writing journey with AnalyticsVidhya in May 2019, I've authored over 30 articles spanning topics from Web Scraping to Data Science, computer vision, Natural language processing, Power BI, Machine Learning and e.t.c. However, as a sole contributor, I often questioned if there were areas for improvement in my work. Seeking validation and constructive criticism, I initially turned to Medium but struggled to garner visibility. Determined to find a platform that offered both exposure and expert feedback, I discovered AnalyticsVidhya's Data Science Blogathon. Participating in these monthly events not only provided me with a receptive audience but also invaluable insights through comprehensive feedback. This feedback loop has not only helped refine my writing but has also bolstered my data analysis skills, making each Blogathon an enriching experience. I'm grateful to AnalyticsVidhya for providing such a supportive platform for aspiring writers and data enthusiasts like myself.

What are the rules for competitions on Analytics Vidhya?
Subject to these Terms and any contract with Analytics Vidhya, a user may post (“Host User”) a skill-based competition or challenge on the Services (“Competition”) for other users to participate in such Competition (“Participant User”). Competitions are subject to separate Competition Rules (defined below) that are established by the Host User. Competitions exclude games of chance, and you may not use or attempt to use the Service to host any such game of chance. Competitions are open to residents of the India and worldwide, except if you are a resident of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, or any other place prohibited by law you may not enter any Competition. Certain Competitions may also have further geographic restrictions and be open only to residents of certain countries.
Go tohttps://www.analyticsvidhya.com/enterpriseand contact our sales team. Competitions are run according to rules that describe participation guidelines, the data set(s) to be used by the Participant Users, the criteria used by the Host User to select a winner of the Competition (the “Metric”), the prize awarded to such winner, and when such prize will be awarded. Such rules and selection criteria must comply with all applicable laws and these Terms (collectively, “Competition Rules”). Such Competition Rules will also include how and when a Participant User must submit Competition Entries (defined below) and the rights the Host User will be granted in such Competition Entry upon selecting such Competition Entry as the winner (“Winning Entry”). The Host User will be granted rights in the Competition Entry only if the winner accepts payment of the prize. Certain rights granted in the Competition Entries and Winning Entries are described in Section 8 below. The Competition Rules may impose additional restrictions or requirements for Competitions.
The Host User must conspicuously display the Metric within the Competition Rules. The Host User must select an objective Metric and must apply that Metric impartially to each Team’s (defined below) selected entries. In selecting a winner, the Host User must apply the Metric and select the Participant Users with the best rankings based on the Metric.
The Host User and each Participant User will comply with all Competition Rules. The Host User (including any user from Host User’s organization) may not compete in its hosted Competition nor cancel a Competition without first contacting us and receiving our consent to such cancellation. Any participation by a Host User (or any user from Host User’s organization) in its hosted Competitions is done so on an ineligible basis (e.g. they cannot receive a prize) and will not otherwise affect the selection of the Winning Entry.
Subject to the Competition Rules, Participant Users may collaborate as a team as long as each such Participant User confirms its team membership through the Service and does not participate on more than one team for a specific Competition (“Team”). To be clear, you may not participate on more than one team per Competition. Subject to the Competition Rules, Teams may, however, merge with other Teams, but the merged Team will be responsible for all past entries by the component Teams. If your Team wins a Competition, the prize for winning will be distributed equally amongst the members of the winning Team, unless we receive identical requests for unequal prize splits from every member of the Team.
You may be a Host User or a Participant User for a specific Competition (but not both!). A Competition creates a direct relationship between a Host User and a Participant User, and Analytics Vidhya will have no liability for any actions or content of a Host User or a Participant User. Analytics Vidhya may provide a Host User with a template for the Competition Rules, but such template is provided without any warranty whatsoever and the Host User is solely responsible for its Competition Rules. It is the sole responsibility of the Host User to ensure that the Competition Rules comply with applicable law.
You acknowledge and agree that Analytics Vidhya may, without any liability but without any obligation to do so, remove or disqualify a Participant User, a Host User or a Competition if Analytics Vidhya believes that such Participant User, Competition or Host User are in violation these Terms or otherwise pose a risk to Analytics Vidhya, the Service or another user of the Service.
Regardless of anything to the contrary, Participant Users acknowledge and agree that Analytics Vidhya and Host Users have no obligation to hold a Competition Entry in confidence or otherwise restrict their activities based on receipt of such Competition Entry. Analytics Vidhya has no obligation to become involved in disputes between users (for example, between a Participant User and a Host User) or between users and any third party relating the use of the Services. All content you access or submit via the Services is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
Do I have to grant any licenses to Analytics Vidhya or to other users?

Also, you grant such Host User a limited license to access and use the Competition Entry solely for the purposes of evaluating the Competition Entry under the Competition Rules. If you win a Competition, your Competition Entry for such Competition will be subject to further licensing as stated in the Competition Rules, but other than the limited licenses stated in these Terms, the intellectual property rights in your Competition Entries will not be transferred or licensed to the Competition Sponsor or Host User unless you accept the payment of the applicable prize stated in the applicable Competition Rules.

Why Analytics Vidhya Collects Information
Analytics Vidhya uses the information we collect for the following purposes:
We use your information to deliver our Services, like administering competitions you enter or hosting datasets you upload or access. For example, we use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a dataset. Another example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Analytics Vidhya account.
We also use your information to ensure our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
And we use your information to make improvements to our Services – for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Analytics Vidhya account members and to improve the way the Services work and look.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our Services, which can help us build better products. It may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
We use the information we collect in existing Services to help us create new features and functionality.
We use the information we collect to customize our Services for you, including remembering your information so that you will not have to log-in again the next time you visit the Services if you haven't signed out. We also use data to provide customized third party content and information and to track your status in any Competitions or other activities. In addition, we may use the information we collect to provide personalized and relevant advertising, for example showing you positions from our jobs board in your location based on your IP address.
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Services and related activities, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by Analytics Vidhya. You can opt-out from Google Analytics by clickinghere.
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity on your account, or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our Services. We will also use your email address to contact you with respect to competition entries, prize awards and otherwise in connection with competitions; for administrative and customer service purposes; to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues; or regarding things you post on the Services. And if you contact Analytics Vidhya, we’ll keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Analytics Vidhya also uses your email address or other personal information to send you messages about the Services and communications from other Members. We may also send you messages related to the Services and the activities of third parties we work with. These messages may be targeted at you based on your activities on our Services, for example your interaction with a particular dataset or your entry into a specific competition. You will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications through links provided in the messages, or by sending us a mail at[email protected]
