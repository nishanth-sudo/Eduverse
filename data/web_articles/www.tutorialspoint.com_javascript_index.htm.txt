Frequently Asked Questions about JavaScript
ThisJavaScript tutorialhas been designed for beginners as well as working professionals to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts and functionalities of JavaScript. It covers most of the important concepts related to JavaScript such asoperators, control flow,functions,objects, OOPs,Asynchronous JavaScript,Events, DOM manipulation and much more.
What is JavaScript
JavaScriptis a lightweight, interpretedprogramminglanguage. It is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications.JavaScriptis very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
Why to Learn JavaScript?
JavaScriptis a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer, especially when they are working in Web Development Domain. We will list down some of the key advantages of learning JavaScript−
JavaScript is the most popularprogramming languagein the world, making it a programmer's great choice. Once you learn JavaScript, it helps you develop great front-end and back-end software using different JavaScript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS, etc.
JavaScript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn JavaScript, you really do not need any special environment setup. For example, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and every browser you know as of today, supports JavaScript.
JavaScript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.
JavaScript usage has now extended tomobile app development,desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as JavaScript Programmer.
Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.
Great thing about JavaScript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.
JavaScript is in all over the world, and companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, PayPal, LinkedIn, etc. also use JavaScript.
Furthermore, JavaScript has more than 1.5 lakh libraries. It is also growing.
A huge community of JavaScript is available on the internet with students, developers, and mentors. So anyone can easily get support.
There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn JavaScript Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn anyprogramming language, not only JavaScript, you just need to code, and code, and finally code until you become an expert.
JavaScript Applications
As mentioned before, JavaScript is one of the most widely usedprogramming languages(Front-end as well as Back-end). It has its presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:
Client side validation− This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and JavaScript plays an important role in validating those inputs at front-end itself.
Manipulating HTML Pages− JavaScript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using JavaScript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.
User Notifications− You can use JavaScript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.
Back-end Data Loading− JavaScript providesAjaxlibrary which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
Presentations− JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentation.
Server Applications− Node JS is built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications includingWeb Servers.
Machine learning− Developers can use the ML5.js library to complete the task related to machine learning.
Game Developments− JavaScript contains multiple libraries and NPM packages to design graphics for the game. We can useHTML,CSS, andJavaScriptwith libraries to develop the games.
Mobile applications− We can use frameworks likeReact Nativeto build feature-rich mobile applications.
Internet of Things (IoT)− JavaScript is used to add functionality to devices like smartwatches, earbuds, etc.
Data visualization− JavaScript contains the libraries likeD3.jsto visualize the data efficiently. The D3.js is also used to prepare high-quality charts to visualize the data.
Cloud computing− We can use JavaScript in serverless computing platforms like Cloudflare andAWS lambdato write and deploy functions on the cloud.
This list goes on, there are various areas where millions of software developers are happily using JavaScript to develop great websites and other software.
Basic JavaScript Example
Below is a basic JavaScript example that will print "Getting started with JavaScript tutorial" on the webpage. You can edit this example and execute it by clicking on the "Edit & Run" button.
<script>
    document.write("Getting started with JavaScript tutorial");
</script>
Online JavaScript Editor
We have providedJavaScript Online Editorwhich helps you toEditandExecutethe code directly from your browser. Try to click the iconto run the following JavaScript code to print conventional "Hello, World!".
Open JS Editor to practice your scripts here
<html>
   <head>
      <title>The JavaScript Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">

Richer interfaces− You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
We can not treat JavaScript as a full fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −
Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
JavaScript can not be used for Networking applications because there is no such support available.
JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocess capabilities.
Yes! JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
